System requirements
+++++++++++++++++++

Leo will work on any platform that supports Python 2.5 or later and Tk 8.4 or later. For
Qt ui, Qt 4.4 or newer (and compatible PyQt) is required.

-   Download the latest version of Leo from `Leo's download page`_.

-   Download Python from: http://python.org/

-   Most installations of Python have Tk pre-installed.
    If your doesn't, you may download it from: http://tcl.activestate.com/software/tcltk/

    **Warning**: When building Tcl on Linux, do **not** specify
    "--enable-threads".
    Only use Tcl with the default "threads not enabled" case.

-   Leo uses `Pmw`_ (Python Mega Widgets). Leo's extensions folder contains a copy
    of Pmw for use if needed. Leo first tries to import Pmw normally. If that
    fails, Leo will use the version of Pmw in the extensions folder.

Leo's HOME directory
++++++++++++++++++++

Python's HOME environment variable specifies Leo's HOME directory.
See http://docs.python.org/lib/os-procinfo.html for details.

Leo uses os.expanduser('~') to determine the HOME directory if no HOME environment variable exists.

Leo puts several files in your HOME/.leo directory:
.leoID.txt, .leoRecentFiles.txt, and myLeoSettings.leo.

How to install Leo on Linux
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you are using Debian/Ubuntu, find and install the debian package. This
provides the best integration with your desktop (file associations, icons, launcher
item). Failing that, follow the instructions below.

Download the latest version of Leo (a .zip file) from `Leo's download page`_.

Unzip the downloaded .zip file into the **unpacked folder** in your home directory.
The unpacked folder will be called something like leo-4-5.

You now have two choices:

1. You can run Leo from your home directory.
   Just add  ~/leo-4-5 to your path.

2. You can install leo into /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/bin by running Leo's install script as follows::

    cd ~/leo-4-4-3-final
    chmod u+x install
    sudo ./install


The install script will instruct you to add /usr/local/bin to your path.
You can, instead, add the following link::

    sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/leo/ /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/

Now you are ready to `run Leo`_.

Installing Leo on MacOS X
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Installing Leo on MacOS 10.5 (Leopard) is straightforward.

1. MacOS 10.5 comes with Python pre-installed.
   See http://www.python.org/download/mac/ and
   http://wiki.python.org/moin/MacPython/Leopard
   for information about using the latest version of Python.

2. Download and install bzr:

   - Download bzr from http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download

   - Install bzr using the file just downloaded.

3. Get Leo's sources from Leo's trunk::

    cd ~
    mkdir leo.repo
    cd leo.repo
    bzr init
    bzr branch lp:leo-editor
    cd leo-editor

4. You can run the tk version of Leo as follows::

    python launchLeo.py --gui=tk

5. If you already have Qt and PyQt installed, you can run the qt version of Leo as follows::

    python launchLeo.py --gui=qt

6. If you don't have Qt or PyQt installed, you will have to install Qt and PyQt
    from sources. There does not seem to be any pre-built binaries.

    A: You may need to install XCode from http://developer.apple.com/mac/
       in order to get a development environment.

    B: Download and install the sip package, following the direction at
       http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download

    C: Download the OpenSource Qt libraries for Mac from
       http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads

    D: At various points along the way you will need to build the sources::

         python configure.py 
         make
         sudo make install

Installing Leo on Windows
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Install Python from http://www.python.org/download/releases/

2. Install PyQt. Get binary package from
   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download which
   matches installed Python version.
   Then run the installer.

3. Install Leo.  Get Leo's .zip file from http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/
   You can unpack the .zip file anywhere, including Python's *site-packages* folder,
   for example, C:\Python25\Lib\site-packages

4. [optional] Generate/update a junction link from unpacked
   leo folder to ...\site-packages\leo

      cd C:\Python25\Lib\site-packages\
      junction leo leo-4-6-2-final

5. Create windows shortcut (edit paths as necessary):

      Target   =  C:\Python25\pythonw.exe "C:\Python25\Lib\site-packages\leo\launchLeo.py"
      Start in =  D:\code

6. Associate .leo filetype batch file:

      ftype LeoFile=C:\Python25\pythonw.exe "C:\Python25\Lib\site-packages\leo\launchLeo.py" "%1"
      assoc .leo=LeoFile

7. [optional] Put this leo.bat in %PATH%:

      @C:\Python25\python.exe -i "C:\Python25\Lib\site-packages\leo\launchLeo.py" %*

Tracking the development version
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Many users will want to track the development version of Leo, in order to stay
on top of the latest features and bugfixes. Running the development version is
quite safe and easy, and it's also a requirement if you want to contribute to
Leo.

1. First, you need to get Bazaar (bzr) from http://bazaar-vcs.org. For windows
   users we recommend the standalone installer - the python installer may have
   problems pushing to Launchpad. Plain bzr installer only contains the command
   line version, so you might want to augment that with a friendly GUI - qbzr is
   recommended as it's the easiest one to install. It provides command like
   bzr qlog, bzr qannotate etc.

2. Get Leo from launchpad by doing::

     bzr branch lp:leo-editor

And that's it! You can run leo/core/leo.py directly. When you want to refresh the
code with latest modifications from Launchpad, run bzr pull.

If you make modifications to Leo (with the interest in sharing them with the Leo
community), you can check them in to your local branch by doing bzr checkin.
Now, to actually request your changes to be merged to Leo trunk, you need a
Launchpad account with RSA keys in place. There is showmedo video about how to
accomplish this in Windows using puttygen and pageant at
http://showmedo.com/videos/video?name=1510070&fromSeriesID=151.

After your Launchpad account is set up, go to
https://launchpad.net/leo-editor, choose "Code" tab -> Register Branch,
select Branch type "Hosted" and fill in descriptive details about the branch.
After that, go to the branch home page from Code tab again, and copy-paste the
push command line to terminal. For example, for branch::

    https://code.launchpad.net/~leo-editor-team/leo-editor/mod_rclick

The push command is::

    bzr push bzr+ssh://my_name@bazaar.launchpad.net/~leo-editor-team/leo-editor/mod_rclick    

You may wish to add --remember command line option to bzr push, to direct all
future pushes to that location. Then, you only need to execute bzr push.

After your branch is pushed, you can email the Leo mailing list and request it
to be reviewed and merged to trunk.

Running Leo
+++++++++++

You can run Leo from a Python interpreter as follows::

    import leo
    leo.run() # runs Leo, opening a new outline or,
    leo.run(fileName=aFileName) # runs Leo, opening the given file name.

Another way to run Leo is as follows::

    cd <path-to-launchLeo.py>
    python launchLeo.py %1

Here are some tips that may make running Leo easier:

**Linux**
    The following shell script will allow you to open foo.leo files by typing leo foo::

        #!/bin/sh 
        python <leopath>launchLeo.py $1

    where <leopath> is the path to the directory containing the leo directory. 

**Windows**
    If you have associated .leo files with Leo you may run Leo by double-clicking any .leo file.
    You can also use a batch file.
    Put the following .bat file in c:\\Windows::

        cd <path-to-leo>
        c:\python25\python <path-to-leo>launchLeo.py %1

    where <path-to-leo> is the path to the directory *containing* the leo directory.

    This opens the file specified by the first argument (%1).

The first time you start Leo, a dialog will ask you for a unique identifier. If
you are using cvs, use your cvs login name. Otherwise your initials will do. Leo
stores this identifier in the file .leoID.txt. Leo attempts to create
leoID.txt in the .leo sub-directory of your home directory, then in Leo's config directory, and
finally in Leo's core directory. You can change this identifier at any time by
editing .leoID.txt.

Running Leo from a console window
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Leo sends more detailed error messages to stderr,
the output stream that goes to the console window. In Linux and MacOS
environments, python programs normally execute with the console window visible.
On Windows, can run Leo with the console window visible by associating .leo
files with python.exe *not* pythonw.exe. 

.. For full instructions about how
.. to do this, see `Associating Leo with .leo Files`_.

Running Leo in batch mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

On startup, Leo looks for two arguments of the form::

    --script scriptFile

If found, Leo enters batch mode. In batch mode Leo does not show any windows.
Leo assumes the scriptFile contains a Python script and executes the contents of
that file using Leo's Execute Script command. By default, Leo sends all
output to the console window. Scripts in the scriptFile may disable or enable
this output by calling app.log.disable or app.log.enable

Scripts in the scriptFile may execute any of Leo's commands except the Edit Body
and Edit Headline commands. Those commands require interaction with the user.
For example, the following batch script reads a Leo file and prints all the
headlines in that file::

    path = r"<path-to-folder-containing-the-leo-folder>\leo\test\test.leo"

    g.app.log.disable() # disable reading messages while opening the file
    flag,newFrame = g.openWithFileName(path,None)
    g.app.log.enable() # re-enable the log.

    for p in newFrame.c.all_positions():
        g.es(g.toEncodedString(p.h,"utf-8"))

How to install the Aspell spell checker
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You must install the Aspell package if you want to use Leo's Spell tab.

1.  Download and install the Aspell package from http://aspell.sourceforge.net/
    Typically this will create a directory called Aspell/bin

2.  Specify the location of the Aspell and Aspell/bin directories using
    the aspell_dir and aspell_bin_dir settings in LeoSettings.leo.
