Improved unit testing
+++++++++++++++++++++

- leoDynamicTest.py now supports a --path argument giving the .leo file.
  This is so useful!

- leoDynamicTest.py now honors the --silent argument.

- leoTest.runUnitTestLeoFile runs all unit tests in a given .leo file
  in a separate process.

- leoTest.runTestsExternally calls runUnitTestLeoFile after creating
  dynamicUnitTest.leo.

- When reporting that no unit tests were found, all unit tests commands tell
  whether the entire outline or just the selected outline was searched.
  This fixes sometimes-misleading error messages.

- test.leo contains a 'run-test.leo-tests' button.

- leoPy.leo contains a 'run-all-core-tests' button.

Improved file handling
++++++++++++++++++++++

- Leo opens a default .leo file if no other is specified, using the @string
  default_leo_file setting. The default for this setting is
  ~/.leo/workbook.leo

- Added escapes for underindented lines. The escape is specified by the @string
  underindent-escape-string setting. By default, this escape is \- If a line
  starts with \-N, Leo will write the line with N fewer spaces than expected.

- Leo now warns when attempting to write a file that has been changed outside of
  Leo. This prevents bzr reversions.

- Leo tests syntax of .py files when saving them.

- Leo can now open any file into an @edit node. This allows Leo to be associated
  with the edit action of .py files. Like this::

    C:\Python26\python.exe "c:\leo.repo\trunk\launchLeo.py" --gui=qt %1 %2

- Leo now warns if when writing an @auto node if the the file exists and the
  node has not been read previously.  This prevents a newly-created
  @auto node from overwriting an existing file.

Improved handling of rST files
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Added support for @auto-rst nodes. These import reStructuredText (rST) files
so that the files can be "round-tripped" without introducing extraneous changes.
This makes Leo a superb environment for using rST.

New code features
+++++++++++++++++

- Added autoCompleter.getExternalCompletions.
  See http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/4ad91984a6d0acac

- Added g.posList.

- c.config.doEnabledPlugins sets g.app.config.enabledPluginsFileName

- Added the following properties:
    - p.b, t.b and v.b return the body string of the position or node.
    - p.h, t.h and v.h return the head string of the position or node.
    - t.u and v.u return the uA of the node.
    - p.gnx, t.gnx and v.gnx return the gnx of the position or node.

- Added script to leoSettings.leo to ensure all menu items are valid.

- c.config.getSettingSource(setting_name)
  returns the name of the file which Leo used to determine the setting:

    - D indicates default settings.
    - F indicates the file being loaded
    - L indicates leoSettings.leo
    - M indicates myLeoSettings.leo

- Predefined 'self' in @test/@suite nodes.

- Added c.getNodePath and c.getNodeFileName.
  See http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/3b5f1232ecc6bba7

New command-line options
++++++++++++++++++++++++

- The --config command-line option specifies a single config (.leo) file
  to use for configuration.
  See http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/f3f95d93bcd93b94

- The --file=fileName command-line option load a file.
  Only .zip and .leo extensions are allowed at present.

- The --gui=name command-line option specifies the gui to use.
  The valid values are --gui=qt, --gui=tk

New commands
++++++++++++

- Added smart home (back-to-home) command.

- Added support for standard behavior of Tab and Shift-Tab keys.
  The tab key indents the text selection, if there is one;
  otherwise, the tab key insert a tab or blanks, depending on the @tabwidth setting.
  Shift-Tab always unindents one or more lines.

- The open command creates @edit nodes when opening non-.leo files
  The open file dialog now shows all files by default.
  Selecting a non-.leo file will load that file into a new node in the present outline.

- Added added pdb minibuffer command.
  This works, but stops Leo in the middle of the command-handling logic.
  You may get the commander c by stepping out into
  k.masterKeyHandler or k.masterCommandHandler.
  Using c, you can then get all other info.

- Improved the isearch commands.

- find-clone-all is a synonym for clone-find-all.

- open-quickstart-leo command opens leo/doc/quickstart.leo.

- The Alt-Right and Alt-Left keys (expand-and-go-right and contract-or-go-left
  commands) now move to the previous or next node if now left/right movement is
  possible.

New and improved directives
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Added @nocolor-node directive.

- Improved \@path handling.

New settings
++++++++++++

- @string default_leo_file = ~/.leo/workbook.leo

- @string underindent-escape-string = \-

- @int icon_bar_widgets_per_row

- Added support for meta keys.
  http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/b6a39ed672a28c65?pli=1

- The qt gui is now the default.

- The old bindings bound the PageUp/Down keys to back/forward page commands, and
  these commands work only for text.

  The new default bindings in leoSettings.leo: @keys EKR bindings are::

    back-page                       ! text = PageUp
    back-page-extend-selection      ! text = Shift-PageUp
    forward-page                    ! text = PageDn
    forward-page-extend-selection   ! text = Shift-PageDn

    scroll-down-half-page   ! tree = Shift-PageDn
    scroll-down-page        ! tree = PageDn
    scroll-up-half-page     ! tree = Shift-PageUp
    scroll-up-page          ! tree = PageUp    

- @bool enable_alt_ctrl_bindings.
  The default is False, needed for AltGr functionality on Windows.

Plugins
+++++++

- Improved nav_buttons plugin and corresponding nodeHistory class.

- Created qtGui and tkGui plugins.

- Created leoGuiPluginsRef.leo.

- Leo issues an error message if a non-existent plugin appears
  in an @enabled-plugin node.
  
- New plugins: spydershell.py, qtframecommands.py, and mod_framesize.py.
