Important new features
**********************

- @test and @suite nodes may now be embedded in external files.
- Added support for chapters to Leo's core

  Chapters are regions of a Leo outline whose root is an @chapter node. @chapter
  nodes may appear anywhere in an outline, but the create-chapter command (see
  below) creates @chapter nodes as children of a single @chapters node.

  Selecting a chapter shows the nodes in the selected chapter; in this
  respect, chapters are like hoists. The main chapter represents the entire
  outline and can not be deleted by name. When chapters are in effect, Leo
  creates a hidden @chapters node containing one @chapter node for every chapter
  except the 'main' chapter.

  Associated settings:

  - The @bool use_chapters setting determines whether chapters are enabled.
  - The @bool use_chapter_tabs setting determines whether the chapters
    pop-up menu appears in the icon area. Choosing a chapter name from this list selects a chapter.

  When chapters are enabled, the Cmds:Chapters menu shows all available chapter commands:

  - The create-chapter command creates an @chapter node and with a single node.
  - The delete-chapter command deletes the presently selected chapter.
  - The select-chapter command makes only the nodes of the selected chapter visible.
  - The move-node-to-chapter, clone-node-to-chapter and copy-node-to-chapter commands
    add a node (and its descendants) to another chapter.

- Added support for compressed .leo files

  Leo now has save-file-as-zipped and save-file-as-unzipped commands, and
  corresponding Save File As Zipped and Save File as Unzipped items in the File
  menu. These are exactly the same as Leo's Save As commands except that they
  temporarily force Leo to write the file in either zipped or unzipped format.
  Leo remembers whether a file was originally zipped. The read logic handles
  either zipped or unzipped .leo files automatically. The write logic will zip
  the file if it was originally zipped or if the save-file-as-zipped command is
  being executed. Leo writes files with .leo extension, regardless of whether
  the file is zipped or not. Zipped .leo files contain a single archive, whose
  name is the same as the .leo file itself.

  **Notes**: The new save commands suffice to compress and expand .leo files on
  a file-by-file basis. In particular, there is no need for any user settings.
  Outside of Leo you can change the extension to .leo.zip and use stuffit or
  other program to expand the .leo file contained within. I've only tested this
  on XP, but it should work everywhere...At present the code uses Python's
  zipfile module to read and write zipped files.

- Added leoBridge module.
  See the `leoBridge chapter`_ for full details.

- Removed all (or almost all) gui-independent from Leo's core.

- Improved support for the winpdb debugger.
  See the `debugging with Leo`_ chapter for full details.
