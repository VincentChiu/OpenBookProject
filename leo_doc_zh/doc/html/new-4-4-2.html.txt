A major code reorg
++++++++++++++++++

Leo's vnode and tnode classes are now completely independent of the rest of Leo.
Some api's have been changed.  This 'big reorg' and may affect scripts and plugins.

New commands
++++++++++++

::

    extend-to-line
    extend-to-paragraph
    extend-to-sentence
    forward-end-word
    forward-end-word-extend-selection

New features
++++++++++++

- Added support for controlling Leo from Emacs_ with pymacs_.
  See `Chapter 18: Leo and Emacs`_ for full details.
- Added Minibuffer and Settings submenus of the Cmds menu.
- At long last Leo creates a proper help menu on the Mac.
- Added a new convention for menu tables. If the first item (a string
  representing the menu label) starts with '*' Leo will convert hyphens to
  spaces and upcase the label. This convention allows a single string to
  represent both the menu label and its associated minibuffer command. As part
  of this reorganization, all menu tables in Leo's core now use only strings.
  This is an essential precondition to supporting @menu nodes in
  leoSettings.leo.
- Leo's Help menu now contains the Open scripts.leo command.
- Leo uses ctypes to import Aspell when run from Python 2.5 or later.
  Leo no longer needs Python-specific versions of aspell.dll.
- Added support for x-windows middle-button paste.
  This only works when the paste is made in the pane containing the selected text.
- Leo looks for myLeoSettings.leo files in the same place Leo looks for leoSettings.leo files.
- Created three scripts (in test.leo) that help create unit tests for Leo's edit commands.
  Create Created runEditCommandTest for use by these scripts.
- Improved print-bindings command.
  The bindings are sorted by prefix: this is a big help in understanding bindings.
  For each prefix, first print items with only a single character after the prefix.
- Made writing .leo files faster.
  The new code almost exactly twice as fast as the old.
- Added p.archivedPosition.
  This is a key first step towards Leap 204.
- Integrated sax with read logic.
- You can now store settings in myLeoSettings.leo without fear of those settings
  being changed by cvs updates or in future versions of Leo.
- Eliminated unnecessary redraws when moving the cursor in the outline pane.
- Much faster navigation through the outline using Alt-arrow keys.
- When focus is in the outline pane, you can move to headlines by typing the first letter of headlines.
- The find command now closes nodes not needed to show the node containing the present match.
- Numerous changes that make Leo easier to use without using a mouse.
- Many new minibuffer commands now appear in the Cmds menu.

Further improved outline navigation:

- Generalized navigation in outline pane to ignore @file, @thin, etc prefixes.
- Made outline navigation cumulative.
  When keystrokes in the outline pane are typed 'close' together Leo first tries to look
  for prefix + ch, where ch is the character just typed and prefix is the previous match.
  The term 'close together' is specified by the setting @float outline_nav_extend_delay.
  The outline search revers to a single-character if the extended search
  fails, so in fact the delay is not too significant. In practice everything works
  well without me thinking at all about what is happening.

New and improved plugins
++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Improved the mod_scripting plugin. Every button created by the plugin creates
  a corresponding command. The command name is the 'cleaned' version of the
  button name. Likewise, the plugin also creates a delete-x-button command,
  where x is the command name as just discussed. So now you can delete script
  buttons without right-clicking.
- Made 'About Plugin' dialog scrollable.
- Fixed bugs in groupoperations, multifile, nodenavigator and shortcut_button plugins.
- The rst3 plugin now registers the rst3-process-tree command.
- The leoOPML.py plugin defines commands to read and write OPML files.
- The slideshow.py plugin allows Leo to run slideshows defined by @slideshow and @slide nodes.
- The leo_to_rtf and leo_to_html plugins create rtf and html files from Leo outlines.
- The paste_as_headlines.py plugins creates multiple headlines at once.
- The word_count.py plugin.

Improved the mod_scripting plugin:

- Made showing the Run Script button optional.
- The Script Button button now creates the press-script-button-button command.
- A new utility method does a much better job of massaging button and command names.

Settings
++++++++

- Removed .leoRecentFiles.txt from the distribution and cvs and added @bool
  write_recent_files_as_needed. The presence or absence of .leoRecentFiles.txt
  no longer controls whether Leo creates and updates .leoRecentFiles.txt.
- Added @bool insert_new_nodes_at_end.
- Added @bool select_all_text_when_editing_headlines.
  Creating a new node always selects the entire text, regardless of this option.
- Leo looks for myLeoSettings.leo files in the same place Leo looks for leoSettings.leo files.
- Added settings for all mod_scripting switches.
- Added @bool collapse_nodes_during_finds.
  This greatly speeds searches that used to open many nodes.
  See: http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3935780
- Added @bool outline_pane_has_initial_focus.
- Added @bool sparse_move_outline_left.
- Added bindings for Alt-Shift-Arrow keys to force an outline move.
- Added @bool use_sax_based_read = False.
  True:  Use a sax-based parser to read .leo files.
  This is slower than using Leo's legacy xml parser, but may solve some unicode problems.

Changed default settings::

    focus-to-body = Alt-D
    focus-to-tree = Alt-T
    toggle-extend-mode = Alt-3

ZODB scripting
++++++++++++++

Leo's vnode and tnode classes can optionally be compatible with ZODB databases,
i.e., they can optionally derive from ZODB.Persistence.Persistent.
See Chapter 17: Using ZODB with Leo for details.
