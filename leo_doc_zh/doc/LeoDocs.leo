<t tx="EKR.20040518070558">Leo 4.2 alpha 2           May 18, 2004

This is an important milestone in Leo's history; the two defining features of
the 4.2 code base are complete:

1. This is the first stable version using the "shared nodes" code base.

Shared nodes dramatically improve the time needed to insert, delete, and move
nodes. Moreover, the new code base is code compatible with the old. Indeed, much
of Leo still uses the old code base. See Chapter 7 for full details of how to
script Leo with the 4.2 code base.

2. This is the first version to use @file-thin for most external files.

@file-thin makes it possible to use Leo effectively in a cvs environment.  Indeed, cvs now contains only a "dummy" version of LeoPy.leo.  The idea is that:

- LeoPyRef.leo hardly ever changes. Developers will download LeoPyRef.leo once
from cvs, then rename LeoPyRef.leo to be LeoPy.leo. LeoPy.leo is private to each
developer.

- Developers will commit and update to cvs only thin external files. There is no
longer any need to keep .leo files and the files derived from them "in synch".

- Similar remarks apply to LeoPlugins.leo. Cvs contains only LeoPluginsRef.leo,
and contributors will need only to submit thin external files.

I have been using the new code base without incident for weeks now, and I am
fairly confident that it is safe to use. Nevertheless, I would suggest routine
caution when dealing with this version until more people have tested it.

Known bugs

- Cutting and pasting an @file-thin node does not work properly. This will be
easy to fix, I think.

- The present algorithm for reading thin external files probably does not handle
properly the situation in which a named node is some kind of grand child of the
referencing node rather than being an immediate child of the referencing node.
This is a rare situation, easily avoided, and it doesn't happen at all in
LeoPy.leo. Nevertheless, something must be done.

Other improvements:

- Fixed a number of problems with using Leo on MacOS X. In particular, Leo now
uses the clover key as is usual on the Mac. More Mac and *nix specific
improvements are coming.

Still to do:

- Perfect import and @import. - Make the Go To Line Number command work with
@file-thin files. - Fix minor bugs and add new features See the "To Do: 4.2"
node in the leoToDo.txt node in LeoPy.leo.</t>

p.v.t.visitedBit was used for two purposes:

- To mark the nodes to be written.
- To mark nodes that are not orphan.

What I did:

- Added t.is/set/clearWriteBit.
- Call t.setWriteBit in putVnode unless we are in a thin node.
- putTnodes tests for t.writeBit rather than t.visitedBit.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518070940.5">What I did:

File format

Added -thin field to @+leo sentinel

Recognizers

- Added vnode recognizers for @file-thin option.
- Added position proxies for vnode recognizers.

Directives &amp; sentinels
- Added support for @all.

Writing

- Added top-level atFile code to write @file-thin tree.
- DO write @file-thin vnodes if there was an error writing the external file.
	- No autosave for @file-thin.
 	- Leo writes @file nodes first, so this is not a problem.
	- putVnode checks orphan bit, which gets set if there was an error.
- Don't write vnodes (or related tnodes) for @file-thin trees. (fileCommands).
- Do write empty nodes in @thin trees.
- Don't generate close node sentinels until all children have been generated.

Reading

- Set at.thinFile when reading thin files.
- Suppressed changed message and related items for thin files.
- Modified scanText4 and allies to read thin external files.
	- Don't look for tnodeList for thin files.
	- Initially, at.lastThinNode is at.root.v
	- readStartNode calls createThinChild
	- createThinChild makes a child of at.lastThinNode if needed and sets at.lastThinNode.
- Updated fc.tnodesDict in at.createThinChild.
	Otherwise clones existing only in two thin files won't be linked properly.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518071415">Leo did not handle moving a node to the root position of the outline correctly.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518075457">Using @ignore with @file-thin is asking for trouble.
If you remove the @ignore and then save, you will lose data.

How to recover the data:
	- Read Outline.
	- Remove @ignore
	- Import External File... </t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.100"></t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.101">-   The New command creates a new Leo main window.

-   The Open command opens an existing Leo file and shows it in a main window.

-   The Close command closes the topmost Leo window,
    giving you an opportunity to save your work if you haven't yet done so.

-   The Save, Save As and Save To commands save the Leo window to a file.
    The Save As command changes the name of the outline being edited;
    the Save To command does not.

    The Save File As Zipped command is the same as the
    Save As command except that the resulting .leo file is compressed with Python's zipfile module.
    Similarly, the Save File As Unzipped command is the same as the Save As command
    except that the resulting .leo file is not compressed.
    The Save, Save As and Save To commands compress the file if it was originally compressed.
    **Note**: Leo writes files with .leo extension, regardless of whether the file is zipped or not.
    Zipped .leo files contain a single archive, whose name is the same as the .leo file itself.
    Outside of Leo you can change the extension to .leo.zip and use stuffit or other program to expand the .leo file
    contained within.

-   The Revert command reloads a file, discarding any changes made to the file since it was last saved.

-   The Recent Files command brings up a submenu containing a list of recently
    opened files. Choosing an item in this submenu opens the selected file or brings
    it to the front.

-   The Clear Recent Files command deletes all entries in the Recent
    Files submenu except the most recent file. The files themselves are not
    affected, just the menu entries.

The following commands are located in the Read/Write menu, part of the File
menu.

-   The Read Outline Only command reads an outline using only the .leo file, not any files derived
    from @file nodes. This command is useful for reverting a project to a
    previously saved state.

-   The Read @file Nodes command updates all @file nodes in an outline.
    This ensures that the state of an outline matches all files derived
    from @file nodes. 

-   The Write Outline Only command saves an outline without writing any @file
    trees. Useful for inserting an @file node into an outline without modifying a
    external file with the same name.

-   The Write @file Nodes command forces an update of all @file trees.

-   The Write Dirty @file Nodes command writes all @file trees that have been changed.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.102">The Open With command allows you to communicate with external editor. When
you select this command Leo creates a temporary file and invokes an external
program. Leo periodically checks whether this temporary file has changed; Leo
changes the corresponding node in the outline if so. You must create the entries
in the Open With submenu. This would typically be done in a hook routine, using
the createOpenWithMenuFromTable routine described in the child of this node. The
@file mod_open_with.py node in LeoPlugins.leo gives a complete example
of handling the Open With menu.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.105">The Tangle, Tangle All and Tangle Marked commands create derived
files from portions of an outline. These commands indent and format the derived
files so that they are easy to read and so that it is clear what sections
produced the code. The .c file in the Examples folder shows the code produced by
the Tangle commands. The Tangle command tangles only the selected portion of
the outline, the Tangle All command tangles the entire outline, and the
Tangle Marked command tangles only marked headlines.

The Tangle commands create a external file, call it F, from each @root
node. This process is like macro expansion. The contents of F are simply the
body text of the @root node, with each section reference replaced by its
definition. Substitution continues until all references to sections are replaced
with their definitions. By default, Tangle commands look for section
definitions only in the suboutline containing the @root directive being
tangled. That is, all sections are assumed to be defined either in the body text
of the headline, say h, containing the
@root directive, or in the body texts of the descendants of h.
The @unit directive changes the default scope of the tangle command, while
the @ignore directive causes the tangle commands to ignore a subtree. For
more details, see: `Tangling @root trees with the Tangle commands`_</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.106">The Untangle, Untangle All and Untangle Marked commands are the
reverse of the corresponding Tangle commands. They update an outline based
on changes made to one or more external files. These are exceptionally useful
commands. For example, suppose you create a new part of the outline and
Tangle it for the first time. When you compile the resulting external files
for the first time, you are likely to get many syntax errors. You could fix
those errors in the outline and Tangle the outline again, but there is a much
easier way: you fix the errors in the external files using the compiler's editor,
then run the untangle command on the part of the outline that created the
external file. The Untangle command updates the selected outline to match the
changes in the external files. It's as simple as that. The Untangle command
marks all the nodes in the outline that it updates; you can examine all such
nodes with the Go To Next Marked command in the Outline menu. You cannot use
Untangle to update doc parts, or leading comments in code parts or "trivial"
whitespace in code parts. This is a limitation of the Untangle command that
cannot be fixed; Untangle has no way of knowing whether leading comments
came from doc parts or are just leading comments.

Untangle never changes the structure of an outline; it never inserts,
deletes or moves nodes. Don't attempt to change the structure of an outline by
modifying external files; it won't work. Also, never delete, move or alter the
sentinel lines in external files written by the Tangle command. Such lines start
with /// followed by a section name. If you change the section name in a
sentinel line Untangle will not update the code in the outline (with the old
name) that generated the renamed section. Untangle now warns about sections that
appear in a external file but not in the outline. Untangle has no trouble with
changed section references in external files; it is only changed sentinel lines
that cause problems. Cloned nodes that generate code in several files may cause
problems for Untangle if not all the code is changed the same way in derived
files. If Untangle is run separately on these external files, Untangle will
update all cloned nodes each time it is run, so only the code in the last
Untangle run will take effect. Therefore, the only reliable way to update
text in cloned nodes is to make the change in the .leo file rather than the
external files.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.108">The Import commands do not attempt to do perfect translations; they merely automate the bulk of the drudgery:

-   The Import to @file command creates an @file node from a file.

-   The Import to @root command creates an @root node from a file.

-   The Import CWEB Files command creates an @file node from a `CWEB`_ file.

-   The Import noweb Files command creates an @file node from a `noweb`_ file.

-   The Import External File command imports all the nodes in a external file into the outline.
    Unlike the read commands, the command preserves no outline structure.

-   The Import Flattened Outline command converts plain text written in MORE format to an outline.

The Import Flattened Outline command brings up a dialog which will accept at
most one file. If that file contains MORE-format text it creates an outline
corresponding to that text. MORE is a now-defunct outliner program. MORE
represents outlines as follows. Headlines are denoted by a leading + or
- character, preceding by zero or more tabs that denote the level of the
headline. Body text follows its headline, with no indentation. The original
MORE format did not escape lines in the body text that started with + or -.
Leo escapes such characters by preceding +, - or backslash with a
backslash.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.109">-   The Outline To CWEB command creates a `CWEB`_ file from the selected outline.

-   The Outline TO noweb command creates a `noweb`_ file from the selected outline.

-   The Flatten Outline command creates a text file in MORE format from the selected outline.
    See the previous section for a discussion of MORE format.

-   The Remove Sentinels command removes all sentinel lines from a file derived from an @file node.

-   The Weave Command formats the selected text and writes it to a file.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.110">The Quit command causes Leo to exit. You may also exit Leo by closing the
main window. You will be prompted to save any file that has been altered but not
saved.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.111"></t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.112">Leo supports unlimited undo and redo. Think of actions that may be undone or
redone as a string of beads. A "bead pointer" points to the present bead.
Performing an operation creates a new bead after the present bead and removes
all following beads. Undoing an operation moves the bead pointer backwards;
redoing an operation moves the bead pointer forwards. The Undo command is
disabled when the bead pointer moves in front of the first bead; the Redo
command is disabled when the bead pointer points to the last bead.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.113">Leo supports the standard editing commands: Cut, Copy, Paste,
Clear and Select All. These commands work with either headline or body
text.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.114">The Shift Left and Shift Right commands shift selected lines in the body
text left or right one tab position. These commands shift the entire line if any
characters in that line are selected.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.115">The Extract, Extract Section and Extract Section Names commands create child nodes whose headline is the first line of the selected body text.

-   The Extract command creates a new node whose headline is the first line of selected body text and
    whose body is all other lines of selected text.
    Previously selected text is deleted from the original body text. 

-   The Extract Section command creates a new node whose headline is the first line of selected text and
    whose body is @code followed by all the other lines of selected text.
    All selected text lines except the first line are deleted from the original body text.
    This command is enabled only if the first line contains nothing but section name.

-   The Extract Section Names command creates one or more child nodes,
    one for each section name in the selected body text.
    The headline of each created node is the section name; the body text is @code followed by a newline.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.116">-   The Convert Tabs command converts leading tabs to blanks in a single node.
-   The Convert Blanks command converts blanks to tabs in a single node.
-   The Convert All Tabs converts leading tabs to blanks throughout the selected tree.
-   The Convert All Blanks command converts leading blanks to tabs throughout the selected tree.

All these commands convert between tabs and blanks using the tab width presently in effect.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.117">The Execute Script command executes body text as a Python script. Leo
execute the selected text, or the entire body text if no text is selected. The
Execute Script command pre-defines the values c, g and p as
follows:

- c is the commander of the outline containing the script.
- g is the leoGlobals modules.
- p is c.p, that is, c.currentPosition().

**Important**: Body text may contain Leo directives and section references. You
can now use all of Leo's features to organize scripts that you execute
interactively. Section definitions must appear in the node containing the script
or in descendant nodes.

Leo preprocesses all scripts by simulating the writing of a external file to a
string. The Execute Script command sets app.scriptDict["script1"] to the
value of the script before preprocessing, and sets app.scriptDict["script2"]
to the value of the script after preprocessing. Scripts may examine and change
app.scriptDict as they please.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.118">The following check boxes options appear in the search dialog and control the operations of the find and change commands.

Clone Find All
    When checked, the the Find All command creates a new root node called Found: *&lt;your search pattern&gt;*.
    This node contains clones of the nodes found by the Find All command.
    It is your responsibility to navigate to this new node and to clean it up when it's no longer needed.

Ignore Case
    When checked, the Find and Change commands ignore the case of alphabetic characters when determining matches.

Mark Changes
    When checked, the Change command marks all headlines whose headline or body text are changed by the command.

Mark Matches
    When checked, the Find and Change commands mark all headlines in which a match is found with the pattern.

Pattern Match
    When checked, the Find and Change commands treat several characters specially in the find pattern.

    - '*'  matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
    - '.'  matches any single character.
    - '^'  matches a newline at the start of a pattern.
    - '$'  matches a newline at the end of a pattern.

Examples::

    "^abc$" matches lines that only contain "abc".
    "^a" matches any line starting with "A".
    "a$" matches any line ending with "a".
    "^*$" matches any line at all.

Reverse
    When checked, the Find and Change commands search backward through the file.

Search Body Text
    When checked, the Find and Change commands search body text.

Search Headline Text
    When checked, the Find and Change commands search headline text.

Show Context
    When checked, the Find All command shows additional context information when printing matches.

Suboutline Only
    When checked, the Find and Change commands search only the currently selected headline and its offspring.

Whole Word
    When checked, the find pattern must match an entire word.
    Words consist of an alphabetic character or underscore, followed by zero or more
    alphabetic characters, numbers or underscores.

Wrap Around
    When checked, the Find and Change commands continues at the top of the file when
    the command reaches the bottom of the file.
    For reverse searches, the find or change command continues at the bottom of the file when
    the command reaches the top of the file.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.134">The Go To Line Number command selects the locations in your outlines corresponding to a line in a external file.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.136">The Insert Body Time/Date and Insert Headline Time/Date commands insert
formatted time and date into body or headline text. You must be editing a
headline to be able to insert the time/date into the headline.
The  body_time_format_string and headline_time_format_string settings
specify the format of the inserted text. These settings are the format string
passed to time.strftime. For a complete list of the format options see
http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-time.html
If the format specified by either of these two settings is erroneous the
"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S" format is used by default, resulting in a time/date
format like::

    1/30/2003 8:31:55</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.137">The Reformat Paragraph command rearranges the words in a text paragraph to fill
each line as full as possible, up to the @pagewidth setting. A paragraph is
delimited by blank lines, Leo directives, and (of course) start and end of text
in a node. The width of the line used by the reformatting operation is governed
by @pagewidth and the indentation that would be applied to the node when
tangled (as part of a @root) or written (as part of a @file).

The command operates on the paragraph containing the insert cursor. If the
insert cursor is on a blank line or directive, nothing happens. If the cursor is
on a line containing text, then the paragraph containing that text line is
reformatted and the insert cursor is moved to the next paragraph.

**Note**: Hanging indentation is preserved. This is most useful for bulleted or
numbered lists, such as::

  1. This is the first paragraph,
     and it has a hanging indentation.

  2. This is the second paragraph,
     and it too has a hanging indentation.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.139">The Match Brackets command is enabled if the cursor is next to one of the
following characters in the body pane:

    ( ) [ ] { } &lt; &gt;

This command looks for the matching character, searching backwards through the
body text if the cursor is next to `)` `]` `}` or `&gt;` and searching forward through the
text otherwise. If the cursor is between two brackets the search is made for the
bracket matching the leftmost bracket. If a match is found, the entire range of
characters delimited by the brackets is highlighted and the cursor is placed
just to the left of the matching characters. Thus, executing this command twice
highlights the range of matched characters without changing the cursor.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.140">Leo stores options in **@settings trees**, outlines whose headline is
@settings. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees not only
in the outline being opened but also in various leoSettings.leo files.
This scheme allows for the following kinds of settings:

- Per-installation or per-machine settings.
- Per-user settings.
- Per-folder settings.
- Per-file settings.

There are four kinds of settings files:

1. **Default settings files**, named **leoSettings.leo**.
   Although they can be used in other ways, they typically contain default settings.

2. **Personal settings files**, named **myLeoSettings.leo**. They provide a way
   of ensuring that your customized settings are not altered when updating Leo
   from bzr or while installing a new version of Leo. The myLeoSettings.leo acts
   much like Python's site-customize.py file. myLeoSettings.leo will never be
   part of any Leo distribution, and it will never exist in Leo's cvs
   repository. This solution is *much* better than trying to update
   leoSettings.leo with scripts.

3. **Machine settings files**, named **LeoSettings.leo** (note the capital 'L'),
   and appearing in a unique directory.

4. **Command-line settings files**, specified using Leo's -c command-line
   option. Any .leo file may be used, provided it has an @settings tree. These
   files typically provide a common set of settings for files scattered in
   various places on the file system.

The following sections describe the kinds of nodes in @settings trees.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.143"></t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.144">-   The Check Outline command checks the outline for consistency.

-   The Check All Python Code and Check Python Code commands report any syntax errors or tabnanny errors.
    These commands mark erroneous nodes and ignore any nodes for which:

        - @ignore is in effect or
        - @language python is in not effect.

-   The Check Python Code and Pretty Print Python Code pretty print body text.
    You can customize this code by overriding the following methods of class prettyPrinter in leoCommands.py::

        putOperator:      puts whitespace around operators.
        putNormalToken:   puts whitespace around everything else.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.145">-   The Insert Headline command inserts a new headline after the presently selected headline,
    either as the next sibling or the first child of the presently selected headline
    if the presently selected headline has children and is expanded.

-   The Clone Node creates a clone of the selected node.
    See `Clones and views`_ for full details about clones.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.146">-   The Cut Outline and Copy Outline commands copy a text
    representation of the outline to the clipboard. This representation is the same
    as the file format with some information deleted.

-   The Paste command (in the Edit menu) copies this representation into the *body* pane.

-   The Paste Node As Clone command pastes the node from the clipboard, retaining the
    identity of nodes.  Thus, if the pasted node already exists in the outline the newly
    pasted node will become of a clone of the already-existing node.

-   The Paste Outline command creates nodes with new identities (new gnx's).</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.147">-   The Expand command expands the currently selected node so that all its children are visible.
-   The Expand All Subheads command expands the currently selected node so that all its offspring are visible.
-   The Expand All command expands all the nodes of the entire tree.
-   The Contract Parent contracts the selected node's parent and selects the parent node.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.148">-   The Hoist command redraws the screen so presently selected tree becomes the only visible part of the outline.
    Hoist commands may be nested.  

-   The De-hoist command restores the outline.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.149">-   The Mark Headline command marks a headline with a red marker  near the leader characters.
-   The Unmark Headline command removes such a mark.
-   The Mark Subheads command marks all offspring of the currently selected node.
-   The Unmark All command removes the marks from the entire tree.

<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.162">The following paragraphs discuss the main benefits of traditional `literate programming`_.
**Note**: none of these benefits depends on printed output.

**Design and coding happen at the highest possible level**.
The names of sections_ are constrained only by one's design skill, not by any
rules of language. You say what you mean, and that becomes both the design and
the code. You never have to simulate a concept because concepts become `section
names`_.

**The visual weight of code is separate from its actual length**.
The visual weight of a section_ is simply the length and complexity of the
section name, regardless of how complex the actual definition of the section
is. The results of this separation are spectacular. No longer is one reluctant
to do extensive error handling (or any other kind of minutia) for fear that it
would obscure the essence of the program. Donald Knuth stresses this aspect of
literate programming and I fully agree.

**Sections show relations between snippets of code**.
Sections_ can show and enforce relationships between apparently unrelated pieces
of code. Comments, macros or functions are other ways to indicate such
relationships, but often sections are ideal. Indeed, a natural progression is to
create sections as a matter of course. I typically convert a section to a
function only when it becomes apparent that a function's greater generality
outweighs the inconvenience of having to declare and define the function.

**Complex section names invite improvements**.
A section name is complex when it implies unwholesome dependencies between the
caller (user) of the section and the section_ itself. Such section names tend to
be conspicuous, so that the programmer is lead to revise both the section name
and its purpose. Many times my attention has been drawn to a poorly conceived
section because I didn't like what its name implied. I have always been able to
revise the code to improve the design, either by splitting a section into parts
or be simplifying its relation to colleagues.

**Sections create a place for extensive comments**.
One of the most surprising thing about literate programming is how severely
traditional programming tends to limit comments. In a conventional program the
formatting of code must indicate structure, and comments obscure that
formatting. Sections_ in literate programming provide a place for lengthy
comments that do not clutter the code at the place the section is
referenced_.

**Section names eliminate mundane comments**.
The section name often says it all. The reference_ to the section says everything
that the user needs to know, and the section name at the point of definition
also eliminates the need for many comments.

**Sections create comments automatically**.
A typical @root node starts out with something like::

	&lt;&lt; includes for class x &gt;&gt;
	&lt;&lt; private data for class x &gt;&gt;
	&lt;&lt; private prototypes for class x &gt;&gt;
	&lt;&lt; functions of class x &gt;&gt;

In the external file there is a comment that looks like this::

	/// &lt;&lt; includes for class x &gt;&gt;

It would be silly to write this comment by hand, though often programmers do
just that in order to have a place holder for a mark in the source file. With
literate programming the situation is different: the comment indicates that the
code came from a particular section_; that is, the comment servers a real
purpose.

**Literate programming clarifies the shape of code**.
These last several paragraphs have discussed comments in detail because the net
effect of "putting comments where they belong" is that comments don't clutter
the code. Section references hide irrelevant detail, so larger-scale patterns
within functions (or declarations) become more apparent. Often just recasting
code into web format has created Aha's about my own code, with no special
attention to recoding or redesign! Recasting a function as a web raises the real
and apparent level of abstraction.

**I spend less time formatting code**.
Formatting no longer has to indicate overall design; sections do that. I am less
obsessive about formatting code; it simply doesn't matter much whether different
sections are formatted consistently because the format of one section has no
effect on the look of other sections. Also, I don't worry about most line breaks
within `documentation parts`, or about adding comment delimiters.

**Literate programming creates a new design dimension**.
Sections_ add a new dimension to the design and coding process. Choices about
what sections do, what they are named, what order they appear in, are choices in
a design space different from "normal" programming. This an abstract concept, to
be sure. However, the previous paragraphs are really a manifestation of
working in this new design space.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.173">Outlines_ add something brand new to traditional literate programming, namely an
explicit mechanism for expressing structure at any level of detail, from largest
overall view to smallest detail. The following paragraphs elaborate on this theme.

**Outlines add context**.
There are too many sections_ in conventional `literate programming`. It becomes
difficult to understand the relationships between sections. Using an outline_ to
express a literate programming instantly solves this problem. The programmer is
always aware of how sections are related.

**Outlines provide scope for commands**.
Outlines_ provide a convenient way of expressing the intended scope of commands.
For example, the Tangle command operates only on the presently selected tree_.
The Extract Section command creates a new section_ as the last child_ of the
present node_.

**Clones create different views and focus attention**.
Clones_ can create different views of the outline. An outline_ can contain many such views.
`Clones &amp; views`_ discusses the implications of clones in detail.

**Outlines increase flexibility**.
Organizer nodes do not affect external files in any way, but organizer nodes
often convey the most information about the structure and design of a large
system. Decoupling structure from content in this way is precisely what is
needed for flexibility: one can reorganize at will without worrying about
changing the meaning of the code.

**Outlines express hierarchy directly**.
Hierarchy is often implicit in programming: for example, the grouping of
functions into files, or the organization of a single file as a set of
functions, etc. An outline_ directly expresses hierarchy. Many of Leo's commands_
operate on the presently selected node. It is natural to apply operations on
selected node_ of the outline.

**reStructuredText is much easier to use than CWEB markup.**
Leo makes it easy to use reStructuredText_ (rST) instead of CWEB markup. For
most purposes, rST suffices, and rST is much easier to use and less intrusive
than CWEB.

**Outlines create new design dimensions**.
There are many ways to express a program as a Leo outline. Such choices are
important. They add clarity to the entire program. These are different *kind* of
choices. They simply can not be expressed at all in other editors. In other
words, such choices exist in a new design space. 

**Leo improves tangling and adds untangling**.
Tangling_ and untangling_ are fundamental operations of `literate programming`_.
Leo tangles and untangles files derived from @file trees automatically. This
is an important convenience.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.181">Leo changes the theory and practice of literate programming as follows:

**Leo reduces the need for comments**.
In particular, bridge or transition phrases are almost always unnecessary in a
Leo outline_. One never needs to say something like, "having just finished
with topic x, we turn now to topic y." Leo's outlines tend to be far less
chatty than flat literate programs.

**Leo reduces the need for printed listings**.
Experience with the Weave command shows that an outline can easily become
unintelligible when printed, no matter how "beautiful" the typeset printout is.
No printed listing can be as clear as Leo's outline view.

**Leo reduces the need for indices and tables of contents**.
You could say the entire outline is a table of contents. Moreover, sections_
must always be defined in a descendant of the node_ containing the `section
reference`_, so there is very little need for an index. 

**Leo shows that outline structure is more powerful than narrative.**
Indeed, narrative style creates severe maintenance problems. The narrative is
soon forgotten, and when that happens it becomes difficult to find anything. The
few times I have tried narrative organization I soon regretted it: things just
weren't where I expected them to be.

**Leo shows that traditional literate programming encourages a too creative approach to programming.**
A dictionary is a better model for programs than a novel. Leo's outlines provide
a more regular organization, while providing space for the most lengthy
discussions when those discussions are required.</t>

<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.224">Naively using plugins can expose you and your .leo files to malicious attacks.
The fundamental principles are::

    Scripts and plugins must never blindly execute code from untrusted sources.

and::

    .leo files obtained from other people may potentially contain hostile code.

Stephen Schaefer summarizes the danger this way::

    I foresee a future in which the majority of leo projects come from
    marginally trusted sources...a world of leo documents sent hither and yon -
    resumes, project proposals, textbooks, magazines, contracts - and as a race
    of Pandora's, we cannot resist wanting to see "What's in the box?" And are
    we going to fire up a text editor to make a detailed examination of the
    ASCII XML? Never! We're going to double click on the cute leo file icon, and
    leo will fire up in all its raging glory. Just like Word (and its macros) or
    Excel (and its macros).

In other words::

    When we share "our" .leo files we can NOT assume that
    we know what is in our "own" documents!

Not all environments are untrustworthy. Code in a commercial cvs repository is
probably trustworthy: employees might be terminated for posting malicious code.
Still, the potential for abuse exists anywhere.

In Python it is very easy to write a script that will blindly execute other scripts::

    # Warning: extremely dangerous code

    # Execute the body text of all nodes that start with `@script`.
    def onLoadFile():
        for p in c.all_positions():
            h = p.h.lower()
            if g.match_word(h,0,"@script"):
                s = p.b
                if s and len(s) &gt; 0:
                    try: # SECURITY BREACH: s may be malicious!
                        exec(s + '\n')
                    except:
                        es_exception()

Executing this kind of code is typically an intolerable security risk.
**Important**: rexec provides *no protection whatever*.
Leo is a repository of source code, so any text operation is potentially malicious.
For example, consider the following script, which is valid in rexec mode::

    badNode = c.p
    for p in c.all_positions():
        &lt;&lt; change `rexec` to `exec` in p's body &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; delete badNode &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; clear the undo stack &gt;&gt;

This script will introduce a security hole the .leo file without doing anything
prohibited by rexec, and without leaving any traces of the perpetrating script
behind. The damage will become permanent *outside* this script when the user
saves the .leo file.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.240">The plugins test suite creates a new convention: if a plugin has a function at
the outer (module) level called unitTest, Leo will call that function when
doing unit testing for plugins. So it would be good if writers of plugins would
create such a unitTest function. To indicate a failure the unitTest just
throws an exception. Leo's plugins test suite takes care of the rest.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.242">Leo reads and writes "foreign" attributes in &lt;v&gt; and &lt;t&gt; elements in .leo files as follows:

- When reading a .leo file, Leo will create t.unknownAttributes or v.unknownAttributes ivars for
  any tnode or vnode whose corresponding &lt;v&gt; or &lt;t&gt; element in the .leo file contains a foreign attribute.

- The unknownAttributes ivars are dictionaries whose keys are the attribute names and whose values are strings.

- When writing a file, Leo will write "foreign" attributes if a vnode or tnode contains an unknownAttributes ivar.

- The only native attribute of &lt;t&gt; elements is tx.

- The native attributes of &lt;v&gt; elements are a, t, vtag and tnodeList.

- The native attributes of &lt;v&gt; elements are marks, expanded and descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes.

- Non-native attributes are called **foreign** attributes.

- Leo performs the usual xml escapes on these strings when reading or writing the unknownAttributes ivars.

Plugins may cause Leo to write such foreign attributes simply by attaching unknownAttributes ivars to a vnode or tnode.
Like this::

	if hasattr(v,"unknownAttributes"):
		v.unknownAttributes ["vnodeIcon"] = pathToIcon
	else:
		v.unknownAttributes = {"vnodeIcon" : pathToIcon}

See the section called "Recommended conventions for plugins" for advice about
how to avoid potential conflicts in naming new attributes.

All members of these dictionaries should be "pickleable". That is, Leo uses
Python's Pickle module to encode all values in these dictionaries. Leo will
discard any attributes that can not be pickled. This should not be a major
problem to plugins. For example, instead of putting a tnode into these
dictionaries, a plugin could put the tnode's gnx (a string) in the dictionary.

Leo writes only t.unknownAttributes when writing @thin trees to the .leo
file. Leo puts (the encoding of) these elements into an attribute called
descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes. This attribute is part of the &lt;v&gt;
element representing the @thin node. Leo does _not_ write
v.unknownAttributes in @thin trees because *only tnodes have gnx's in
thin external files*. In effect, vnodes are anonymous. We could attempt to get
around this by identifying vnodes by their corresponding tnodes, but that's not
a general solution and it is, in effect, equivalent to writing only
t.unknownAttributes. So it seems pointless to "pretend" to be writing
v.unknownAttributes.

The effect of this is to make all vnodes identical, as far as using
unknownAttributes is concerned. This won't work in all cases. For example, a
plugin that creates an arbitrary directed graph between vnodes must distinguish
between joined vnodes. In that case, the plugin should confine itself to @file
trees, or just vnodes in .leo files, for that matter.</t>

<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.247">In May of 1999 I began work on the Borland version of Leo for Windows.  The Borland Delphi classes were a pleasure to use and free of bugs.  I redesigned Leo's file format for the Windows version of Leo;  the Yellow Box file format is a binary format that requires the Yellow Box runtime.  Fortunately, I choose to use XML for Leo's file format. I have Marc-Antoine Parent to thank for this decision; he urged me to use XML and patiently explained how to use XML properly.  However, there are two significant problems with the Borland version of Leo.  First, it works only on Windows.  Second, it can never be Open software, because it uses Borland's Delphi classes and a commercial syntax coloring component.

In October of 2001 I began work on the leo.py, an Open Software version of leo.py, a version of Leo written in Python and Tk.  At last I have found the proper platform for Leo.  leo.py naturally supports scripting in Python.  The combination of Python and Tk is incredibly powerful, very easy to use, and truly cross platform.  I rewrote Leo in Python in about two months!  For the first time in my career I no longer am anxious while programming; it simply isn't possible to create bad bugs in Python.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.248">The following sections give a pseudo-chronological list of the major Aha's
involved in creating Leo2. These Aha's form the real design and theory of
operation of Leo. See the "Diary", "Notes" and "Letters to Speed Ream" sections
in LeoDocs.leo for a more accurate and less tidy history of Leo2.

I am writing these notes for several reasons. First, the initial design and
coding of Leo2, spanning a period of about 8 weeks, was some of the most
creative and rewarding work I have ever done. The result is elegant and simple.
I'm proud of it. Second, much of the design work is not reflected in the code,
because improved design often eliminated code entirely. The final code is so
elegant that it obscures the hard work that created it. Third, you must
understand this design in order to understand the implementation of @file trees
and their external files. Someday someone else may take charge of Leo. That
person should know what really makes Leo2 work.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.249">In the summer of 2001 I began work on a project that for a long time I had
considered impossible. I had long considered that "private" file formats such as
.leo files were the only way to represent an outline properly and safely. I'm
not sure exactly what changed my mind, but I finally was willing to consider
that information embedded in external files might be useful. This meant accepting
the possibility that sentinel lines might be corrupted. This was a crucial first
step. If we can trust the user not to corrupt sentinel lines than we can embed
almost any kind of information into a external file.

There were several motivations for this work. I wanted to eliminate the need for
explicit Tangle and Untangle commands. I thought of this as "Untangle on
Read/Tangle on Write." If tangling and untangling could be made automatic it
would save the user a lot of work. I also wanted to make external files the
primary sources files. .leo files might be made much smaller external files
contained the primary source information. This hope turned out to be false.

The result of this design work was something I originally called Leo2, though I
now usually prefer to talk about @file trees. Initially most design issues were
unresolved or unknown. I resolved to attempt a robust error-recovery scheme, not
knowing in advance what that might involve. I also wanted to solve what I
thought of as the "cross-file clone" problem: clones that point from a .leo
outline into a external file. With Leo1 cross-file clones do not exist;
everything is in the same .leo file. It was clear that Leo2 would have to change
some aspects of clones, but all details were fuzzy.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.250">The next step was also crucial. I started to use Leo1 as a prototype to design
what the new body pane would look like to the user. In retrospect, using Leo1 as
a prototype for Leo2 was just as inspired as using MORE as a prototype for Leo1.
Both prototypes marked the true beginning of their respective projects. The Leo2
prototype was a mockup in Python of the code for reading and writing derived
files. The file LeoDocs.leo contain these first prototype nodes.

Writing the prototype got me thinking about improving noweb. With my experience
with Leo1, I was able to create a new markup language that took advantage of
outline structure. I called the new language "simplified noweb", though that
terminology is obsolete. I created @file nodes to distinguish between the old
and new ways of creating external files. In Leo1, the @code directive is simply
an abbreviation for a section definition line. Simplified noweb used @c as an
abbreviation for @code. More importantly, simplified noweb used @c to separate
doc parts from code parts without necessarily specifying a section name. It
quickly became apparent that most nodes could be unnamed. All I needed was the
@others directive to specify the location for all such unnamed nodes.

From the start, simplified noweb was a joy to use. Indeed, the @others directive
could replace all section definition lines. Furthermore, I could make @doc
directive optional if the body pane started in "code mode". But this meant that
plain body text could become a "literate" program! This was an amazing
discovery. These Aha's got me excited about Leo2. This was important, as it
motivated me to do a lot of difficult design work.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.251">In spite of this excitement, I was uneasy. After much "daydreaming" I realized
that I was afraid that reading and writing external files would be interrupted by
a long series of alerts. I saw that designing the "user interaction" during
reading and writing would be very important. The next Aha was that I could
replace a long series of alerts with messages to the log window, followed by a
single "summary" alert. Much later I saw how to eliminate alerts entirely.

At this time I thought there would be two kinds of "errors" while reading
external files. Warnings would alert the user that something non-serious had
happened. True errors would alert the user that data might have been lost.
Indeed, if Leo2 saves orphan and ignored nodes in a .leo file under an @file
node, then read errors could endanger such nodes. Much later I saw that a robust
error recovery scheme demands that @file nodes not contain orphan and @ignored
nodes. (More on this subject later.) But if orphan and @ignored nodes are moved
out of @file trees, there are no read errors that can cause data loss! So the
distinction between warnings and errors finally went away.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.252">I next turned my attention to writing @file nodes. A huge Aha: I realized that
sentinel lines must contain both a leading and a trailing newline. The general
principle is this: the write code must contain absolutely no "conditional"
logic, because otherwise the read code could not figure out whether the
condition should be true or false. So external files contain blank lines between
sentinel lines. These "extra" newlines are very useful, because the read
(untangle) code can now easily determine exactly where every blank, tab and
newline of the external file came from. It would be hard to overstate how
important this simplifying principle was in practice.

Much later, with urging from a customer, I realized that the write code could
safely remove "extra" newlines between sentinels with a caching scheme in the
low level atFile::os() routine. This scheme does not alter the body of the write
code in any way: in effect, sentinels still contain leading and trailing
"logical" newlines. The read code had to be modified to handle "missing" leading
newlines, but this can always be done assuming that sentinels still contain
logical leading and trailing newlines!

At about this time I designed a clever way of having the write code tell the
read code which newlines were inserted in doc parts. (The whole point of doc
parts is to have the write code format long comments by splitting long lines.)
To quote from my diary:

"We can use the following convention to determine where putDocPart has inserted
line breaks: A line in a doc part is followed by an inserted newline if and only
if the newline is preceded by whitespace. This is a really elegant convention,
and is essentially invisible to the user. Tangle outputs words until the line
would become too long, and then it inserts a newline. To preserve all
whitespace, tangle always includes the whitespace that terminates a word on the
same line as the word itself. Therefore, split lines always end in whitespace.
To make this convention work, tangle only has to delete the trailing whitespace
of all lines that are followed by a 'real' newline."</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.253">After the write code was working I turned my attention to the read (untangle)
code. Leo's Untangle command is the most complex and difficult code I have ever
written. Imagine my surprise when I realized that the Leo2 read code is
essentially trivial! Indeed, the Leo2 untangle code is like an assembler. The
read code scans lines of a external files looking for "opcodes", that is,
sentinel lines, and executes some simple code for each separate opcode. The
heart of this code is the scanText routine in atFile.cpp.

The read code was written and debugged in less than two days! It is the most
elegant code I have ever written. While perfecting the read code I realized that
sentinel lines should show the complete nesting structure found in the outline,
even if this information seems redundant. For example, I was tempted to use a
single sentinel to represent an @other directive, but finally abandoned this
plan in favor of the @+other and @-other sentinels.

This redundancy greatly simplified the read code and made the structure of
external files absolutely clear. Moreover, it turned out that we need, in
general, all the information created by the present sentinel lines. In short,
sentinels are as simple as they can be, and no simpler.

The atFile::createNthChild method is a very important: it ensures that nodes
will be correctly inserted into the outline. createNthChild must be bullet-proof
if the Read code is to be robust. Note that the write code outputs @node
sentinels, that is, section definitions, in the order in which sections are
referenced in the outline, not the order in which sections appear in the
outline. So createNthChild must insert the n'th node of parent p properly even
if p contains fewer than n-1 children! The write code ensures that section
references are properly nested: @node sentinels are enclosed in @node sentinels
for all their ancestors in the @file tree. createNthChild creates dummy siblings
as needed, then replaces the dummy siblings later when their actual definitions,
that is, @node sentinels, are encountered.

At this point the fundamental read/write code was complete. I found three minor
bugs in the code over the next week or so, but it was clear that the read/write
code formed a rock-solid base from which to continue design and implementation.
This was an entirely unexpected surprise.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.254">At this point I could read and write external files "by hand", using temporary
Read and Write commands. The next step was to integrate the reading and writing
of external files with the loading and saving of .leo files. From time to time I
made minor changes to the drivers for the read/write code to accommodate the
Load and Save code, but at no time did I significantly alter the read or write
code itself.

The user interaction of the Load and Save commands drove the design and
implementation of the load/store code. The most important questions were: "what
do we tell the user?", and "what does the user do with the information?" It
turns out that the user can't make any complex decision during error recovery
because the user doesn't have nearly enough information to make an informed
choice. In turn, this means that certain kinds of error recovery schemes are out
of the question...</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.255">I now turned my attention to "attributes" of nodes. Most attributes, like user
marks, are non-essential. However, clone information is essential; we must never
lose clone links. At this time I had a preliminary design for cross-file clones
that involved a two part "pointer" consisting of a full path name and an
immutable clone index within the external file. Eventually such pointers
completely disappeared, but the immutable clone indices remain.

My first thought was that it would be good to store all attributes in @node
sentinels in the external file, but experience showed that would be irritating.
Indeed, one wants Leo2 to rewrite external files only if something essential has
changed. For example, one doesn't want to rewrite the external file just because
a different node as been selected.

At this point I had another Aha: we can use the .leo file to store all
non-essential attributes. For example, this means that the .leo file, not the
external files, will change if we select a new node. In effect, the .leo file
mirrors the external file. The only reason to store nodes in the .leo file under
an @file node is to carry these attributes, so Leo2 wrote dummy nodes that do
not reference body text. Much later I saw that dummy nodes were dangerous and
that .leo files should contain all information found in external files.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.256">The concept of mirroring created a huge breakthrough with cross-file clones:
Here is an excerpt of an email i sent to my brother Speed:

"I realized this morning that since a .leo file contains dummy vnodes for all
nodes in a external file, those dummy nodes can carry clone info! I changed one
line to make sure that the write code always writes clone info in dummy vnodes
and voila! Cross-file clones worked!"

All of Leo1's clone code could be used completely unchanged. Everything "just
works".</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.257">At first I thought we could make sure that the .leo file always correctly
mirrors all external file, but disastrous experience showed that is a completely
false hope. Indeed, backup .leo files will almost never mirror external file
correctly. So it became urgent to find a completely fool-proof error recovery
scheme.

I had known for quite a while that error recovery should work "as if" the
mirroring nodes were deleted, then recreated afresh. Several failed attempts at
an error recovery scheme convinced me that error recovery would actually have to
delete all dummy nodes and then do a complete reread. This is what Leo2 does.

But erasing dummy nodes would destroy any orphan and ignored nodes--by
definition such nodes appear nowhere in the external file. Therefore, I had to
enforce the rule that @file nodes should contain no such nodes. Here is an email
I wrote to my brother, Speed Ream discussing what turned out to be the
penultimate error recovery scheme:

"The error recovery saga continues. After much pondering and some trial coding I
have changed my mind about orphans and @ignored nodes. They simply should never
appear as descendants of @file nodes. Fortunately, this simplifies all aspects
of Leo2. Leo2 will issue a warning (not an error) if an orphan or @ignored node
appears as the descendant of an @file node when a .leo file is being saved. If
any warnings occur while writing the external file, Leo2 will write the
"offending" @file tree to the .leo file instead of the external file. This has
several advantages:

1. The user gets warned about orphan nodes. These are useful warnings! Orphan
nodes arise from missing @others directives or missing section references.

2. The user doesn't have to change anything immediately in order to save an
outline. This is very important. Besides warnings about orphans, Leo2 will also
warn about undefined or unreferenced sections. User's shouldn't have to fix
these warnings to do a Save!

3. No errors or alerts will occur during Reading or Writing, so the user's
anxiety level goes way down. At worst, some informational message will be sent
to the log. The user will never have to make important decisions during Loads or
Saves. [At last the dubious distinction between errors and warnings disappears.]

4. Error recovery can be bullet-proof. Simple code will guarantee that after any
read operation the structure of an @file node will match the structure of the
external file. Also, sentinels in external files will now account for all children
of an @file node. There are no more "missing nodes" that must be filled in using
the .leo file. Finally, error recovery will never change the @file tree in any
way: no more "recovered nodes" nodes.

5. The present read code can be used almost unchanged. The only addition is the
posting of a warning if the structure of the .leo file does not match the
structure of the external file. We need a warning because non-essential attribute
of nodes (like user marks) may be altered."

This ends the original history of Leo2. In fact, it took quite a while before
Leo recovered properly from all errors. I finally saw that .leo files should
duplicate all information in external files. This allows a .leo file to be used a
single backup file and allows maximal error recovery in all situations. It took
several months to stamp out several subtle bugs involving clones that caused
spurious read errors. Such errors undermine confidence in Leo and can cause
disastrous reversions. See my diary entries for January 2002 in leo.py for
details.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.259">The more I look at Tk, the more convinced I am that Python + Tk (aka Tkinter)
is, by far, the best way to go with Leo. I now have Open Source code for tree
widgets and splitter windows, and have intensely studied how to modify that code
for use in Leo. It is clear, even at this early date, that this code will
provide a very pleasant base on which to build Leo.

The tree code is based on code in IDLE, the Python IDE. This code is simple,
good and plenty fast enough. The tree code draws directly to a Tk canvas object.
The look and feel matches Windows exactly. It would be trivial to use Mac
triangle icons instead of the Windows plus and minus icons. It would also be
trivial to modify the look and feel for Linux.

The tree widget code solves several intractable problems with wxTreeCtrl.
Moving nodes becomes trivial. Bugs in wxTreeCtrl involving editing and
redrawing disappear. Using Python/Tk code simplifies the vnode class, and having
access to the vnode class simplifies and speeds up the tree widget code. It will
now be possible to bind keystrokes properly; this simply can not be done in
wxWindows. The tree widget code shows just how trivial the Windows native
tree control is. The Tk canvas is a splendid example of higher-level code being
superior, in every way, to lower level code.

Another big win comes from using the Tk text widget. This widget is
extraordinarily powerful. The only text control that rivals it is the
MacOS/Yellow Box text control. Indeed, the Tk text widget does everything that
Leo could possibly want. One can even embed images in text.

In short, using Tk for Leo will be fast enough and will greatly increase what is
possible in Leo while at the same time greatly simplifying Leo's code. I am
about to convert Leo from wxPython to Python + Tk.

<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.260">I've known for a while that Python was interesting; I attended a Python
conference last year and added Python support to Leo. But last week I got that
Python is something truly remarkable. I wanted to convert Leo from wxWindows to
wxPython, so I began work on c2py, a Python script that would help convert from
C++ syntax to Python. While doing so, I had an Aha experience. Python is more
than an incremental improvement over Smalltalk or C++ or objective-C; it is
"something completely different". The rest of this post tries to explain this
difference.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.261">@language rest</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.262">All versions of Leo are organized as a collection of classes. The general
organization of Leo has remained remarkably stable throughout all versions of
Leo, although the names of classes are different in different versions.
Smalltalk's Model/View/Controller terminology is a good way think about Leo's
classes. **Model classes** represent the fundamental data. The vnode and tnode
classes are Leo's primary model classes.

**View classes** draw the screen. The main view classes are leoFrame.py and
leoTree.py. The colorizer class in leoColor.py handles syntax coloring in the
body pane. Leo's view classes know about data stored in the vnode class. Most
events (keystrokes and mouse actions) in the outline and body pane are handled
in the leoTree class. The leoFrame class also creates the Leo window, including
menus, and dispatches the appropriate members of the controller classes in
response to menu commands.

**Controller classes** (aka commanders) control the application. In Leo,
controllers mostly handle menu commands. Commanders create subcommanders to
handle complex commands. The atFile class reads and writes files derived from
\@file trees. The LeoFind class handles the Find and Change commands. The
leoImportCommands class handles the Import and Export commands, the
tangleCommands class handles the Tangle and Untangle commands and the undoer
class handles the Undo command. Other classes could be considered controller
classes.

Each Leo window has its own commander and subcommanders. Subcommanders are not
subclasses of their commander. Instead, subcommanders know the commander that
created them, and call that commander as needed. Commanders and subcommanders
call the model and view classes as needed. For example, the Commands class
handles outline commands. To move a headline, the commander for the window calls
a vnode move routine to alter the data, then calls the view class to redraw the
screen based on the new data.

A singleton instance of the **LeoApp** class represents the application itself.
All code uses the app() global function to gain access to this singleton member.
The ivars of the LeoApp object are the equivalent of Leo's global variables.
leo.py uses no global Python variables, except the gApp variable returned by
app(). leoGlobals.py defines all application constants. Naturally, most
constants are local to the class that uses them.

Several classes combine aspects of model, view and controller. For example, the
**LeoPrefs** class represents user preferences (model), the Preference Panel
(view) and the Preferences menu command (controller). Similarly, the **LeoFind**
class represents find settings, the Find/Change dialog, and the Find/Change
commands.

We use the following convention throughout this documentation. Any variable
named c is a commander, i.e., an instance of the Commands class in
leoCommands.py. Variables named v and t are vnodes and tnodes respectively.
These classes are defined in leoNodes.py.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.263">The vnode and tnode classes represent most of the data contained in the outline.
These classes are Leo's fundamental Model classes. A **vnode** (visual node)
represents a headline at a particular location on the screen. When a headline is
cloned, vnodes must be copied. vnodes persist even if they are not drawn on the
screen. Commanders call vnode routines to insert, delete and move headlines.

The vnode contains data associated with a headline, except the body text data
which is contained in tnodes. A vnode contains headline text, a link to its
tnode and other information. Vnodes contain structure links: parent, firstChild,
next and back ivars. To insert, delete, move or clone a vnode the vnode class
just alters those links. The Commands class calls the **leoTree** class to redraw
the outline pane whenever it changes. The leoTree class knows about these
structure links; in effect, the leoTree and vnode classes work together.

A **tnode**, (text node) represents body text. All vnodes that are clones of
each other share the same tnode. In other words, tnodes are the unit of sharing
of body text. The tnode class is more private than the vnode class. Most
commanders deal only with vnodes, though there are exceptions.

Because Leo has unlimited Undo commands, Leo deletes vnodes and tnodes only when
a window closes. Leo deletes nodes indirectly using destroy methods. Several
classes, including the vnode, tnode, leoFrame and leoTree classes, have
destroy methods. destroy methods merely clear links so that Python's and
Tkinter's reference counting mechanisms will eventually delete vnodes, tnodes
and other data when a window closes.

Leo's XML file format uses **tnode indices** to indicate which tnodes (t
elements) belong to which vnodes (v elements). Such indices are required. Even
if we duplicated the body text of shared tnodes within the file, the file format
would still need an unambiguous way to denote that tnodes are shared. Present
versions of Leo use **gnx's** (global node indices) as node indices. These indices
do not change once a node has created. This reduces cvs conflicts.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.264">Leo must redraw the outline pane when commands are executed and as the result of mouse and keyboard events.
The main challenges are eliminating flicker and handling events properly.
These topics are interrelated.

**Eliminating flicker**. Leo must update the outline pane with minimum flicker.
Various versions of Leo have approached this problem in different ways. The
drawing code in leo.py is robust, flexible, relatively simple and should work in
almost any conceivable environment. Leo assumes that all code that changes the
outline pane will be enclosed in matching calls to the c.beginUpdate and
c.endUpdate methods of the Commands class. c.beginUpdate() inhibits drawing
until the matching c.endUpdate(). These calls may be nested; only the outermost
call to c.endUpdate() calls c.redraw() to force a redraw of the outline pane.

Code may call c.endUpdate(flag) instead of c.endUpdate(). Leo redraws
the screen only if flag is true. This allows code to suppress redrawing entirely
when needed. For example, here is how the idle_body_key event handler in
leoTree.py conditionally redraws the outline pane::

	redraw_flag = false
  	c.beginUpdate()
	val = v.computeIcon()
	if val != v.iconVal:
		v.iconVal = val
		redraw_flag = true
	c.endUpdate(redraw_flag) # redraw only if necessary

The leoTree class redraws all icons automatically when c.redraw() is called.
This is a major simplification compared to previous versions of Leo. The entire
machinery of drawing icons in the vnode class has been eliminated. The
v.computeIcon method tells what the icon should be. The v.iconVal ivar
tells what the present icon is. The event handler simply compares these two
values and sets redraw_flag if they don't match.

**Handling events.** Besides redrawing the screen, Leo must handle events or
commands that change the text in the outline or body panes. It is surprisingly
difficult to ensure that headline and body text corresponds to the vnode and
tnode corresponding to presently selected outline, and vice versa. For example,
when the user selects a new headline in the outline pane, we must ensure that 1)
the vnode and tnode of the previously selected node have up-to-date information
and 2) the body pane is loaded from the correct data in the corresponding tnode.
Early versions of Leo attempted to satisfy these conditions when the user
switched outline nodes. Such attempts never worked well; there were too many
special cases. Later versions of Leo, including leo.py, use a much more direct
approach. The event handlers make sure that the vnode and tnode corresponding to
the presently selected node are always kept up-to-date. In particular, every
keystroke in the body pane causes the presently selected tnode to be updated
immediately. There is no longer any need for the c.synchVnode method, though
that method still exists for compatibility with old scripts.

The leoTree class contains all the event handlers for the body and outline
panes. The actual work is done in the idle_head_key and idle_body_key methods.
These routines are surprisingly complex; they must handle all the tasks
mentioned above, as well as others. The idle_head_key and idle_body_key methods
should not be called outside the leoTree class. However, it often happens that
code that handles user commands must simulate an event. That is, the code needs
to indicate that headline or body text has changed so that the screen may be
redrawn properly. The leoTree class defines the following simplified event
handlers: onBodyChanged, onBodyWillChange, onBodyKey, onHeadChanged and
onHeadlineKey. Commanders and subcommanders call these event handlers to
indicate that a command has changed, or will change, the headline or body text.
Calling event handlers rather than c.beginUpdate and c.endUpdate ensures that
the outline pane is redrawn only when needed.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.265">New in Leo 4.7. All clones of a node **are the same node**. This is the
so-called **one-node** world. In this world, vnodes represent data, generators
and positions represent the location of the data in an outline.  This is a much
simpler world than all previous data representations.

In Leo versions 4.2 to 4.6 clones were represented by sharing **tnodes**. Cloned
vnodes shared the same tnode. This shared tnode represented the entire shared
subtree of both clones. Thus, the _firstChild link had to reside in
*tnodes*, not *vnodes*.

Prior to Leo version 4.2, Leo duplicated all the descendants of vnode v when
cloning v. This created many complications that were removed in the shared tnode
world. In particular, in the shared tnode scheme a vnode v is cloned if and only
if len(v.vnodeList) &gt; 1.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.266">The find and change commands are tricky; there are many details that must be
handled properly. The following principles govern the LeoFind class:

1.  Find and Change commands initialize themselves using only the state of the
    present Leo window. In particular, the Find class must not save internal
    state information from one invocation to the next. This means that when the
    user changes the nodes, or selects new text in headline or body text, those
    changes will affect the next invocation of any Find or Change command.
    Failure to follow this principle caused all kinds of problems in the Borland
    and Macintosh codes. There is one exception to this rule: we must remember
    where interactive wrapped searches start. This principle simplifies the code
    because most ivars do not persist. However, each command must ensure that
    the Leo window is left in a state suitable for restarting the incremental
    (interactive) Find and Change commands. Details of initialization are
    discussed below.

2.  The Find and Change commands must not change the state of the outline or body
    pane during execution. That would cause severe flashing and slow down the
    commands a great deal. In particular, the c.selectPosition and c.editPosition
    methods must not be called while looking for matches.

3.  When incremental Find or Change commands succeed they must leave the Leo
    window in the proper state to execute another incremental command. We
    restore the Leo window as it was on entry whenever an incremental search
    fails and after any Find All and Change All command. Initialization involves
    setting the self.c, self.v, self.in_headline, self.wrapping and
    self.s_text ivars.

Setting self.in_headline is tricky; we must be sure to retain the state of
the outline pane until initialization is complete. Initializing the Find All and
Change All commands is much easier because such initialization does not depend
on the state of the Leo window. Using Tk.Text widgets for both headlines and
body text results in a huge simplification of the code.

Indeed, the searching code does not know whether it is searching headline or
body text. The search code knows only that self.s_text is a Tk.Text widget that
contains the text to be searched or changed and the insert and sel Tk attributes
of self.search_text indicate the range of text to be searched. Searching
headline and body text simultaneously is complicated. The selectNextVnode()
method handles the many details involved by setting self.s_text and its insert
and sel attributes.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.267">This section describes Leo's explicit Tangle and Untangle commands. Such
commands operate only on @root and @unit trees. The previous chapter discusses
the implicit Tangle on Write/Untangle on Read processes used to read and write
@file trees.

The Tangle command translates the selected @root tree into one or more
well-formatted C source files. The outline should contain directives, sections
references and section definitions, as described in Chapter 4. The Untangle
command is essentially the reverse of the Tangle command. The Tangle command
creates a external file from an @root tree; the Untangle command incorporates
changes made to external files back into the @root tree.

The Tangle command operates in two passes. The first pass discovers the complete
definitions of all sections and places these definitions in a symbol table. The
first pass also makes a list of root sections. Definitions can appear in any
order, so we must scan the entire input file to know whether any particular
definition has been completed.

This second pass creates one file for each @root node. Tangle rescans each
section in the list of roots, copying the root text to the output and replacing
each section reference by the section's definition. This is a recursive process
because any definition may contain other references. We can not allow a section
to be defined in terms of itself, either directly or indirectly. We check for
such illegally recursive definitions in pass 2 using the section stack class.
Tangle indicates where sections begin and end using comment lines called
sentinel lines. The this part of the appendix discusses the format of the
sentinels output by the Tangle command.

The key design principle of the Tangle command is this::

    Tangle must output newlines in a context-free manner.

That is, Tangle must never output conditional newlines, either directly or
indirectly. Without this rule Untangle could not determine whether to skip or
copy newlines.

The Tangle command increases the indentation level of a section expansion the
minimum necessary to align the section expansion with the surrounding code. In
essence, this scheme aligns all section expansions with the line of code in
which the reference to the section occurs. In some cases, several nested
sections expansions will have the same indentation level. This can occur, for
example, when a section reference in an outline occurs at the left margin of the
outline.

This scheme is probably better than more obvious schemes that indent more
"consistently." Such schemes would produce too much indentation for deeply
nested outlines. The present scheme is clear enough and avoids indentation
wherever possible, yet indents sections adequately. End sentinel lines make this
scheme work by making clear where the expansion of one section ends and the
expansion of a containing section resumes.

Tangle increases indentation if the section reference does not start a line.
Untangle is aware of this hack and adjusts accordingly. This extra indentation
handles several common code idioms, which otherwise would create under-indented
code. In short, Tangle produces highly readable output, given the necessity
of preserving newlines for Untangle.

Untangle is inherently complex. It must do a perfect job of updating the
outline, especially whitespace, from expansions of section definitions created
by the Tangle command. Such expansions need not be identical because they may
have been generated at different levels of indentation. The Untangle command
can not assume that all expansions of a section will be identical in the derived
file; within the external file, the programmer may have made incompatible changes
to two different expansions of the same section. Untangle must check to see
that all expansions of a section are "equivalent". As an added complication,
external files do not contain all the information found in @root trees.
@root trees may contain headlines that generate no code at all. Also, an
outline may define a section in several ways: with an @c or @code
directive or with a section definition line. To be useful, Untangle must handle
all these complications flawlessly. The this part of the appendix discusses the
various conventions used in the sentinels output by the Tangle command.
These conventions allow the Untangle command to recreate whitespace
correctly.

Untangle operates in two passes. The first pass finds definitions in the
external file and enters them into the **Untangle Symbol Table**, or UST.
Definitions often include references to other sections, so definitions often
include nested definitions of referenced sections. The first pass uses a
definition stack to keep track of nested definitions. The top of the stack
represents the definition following the latest reference, except for the very
first entry pushed on the stack, which represents the code in the outline that
contains the @root directive. The stack never becomes empty because of the
entry for the @root section. All definitions of a section should
match--otherwise there is an inconsistent definition. This pass uses a forgiving
compare routine that ignores differences that do not affect the meaning of a
program.

The second pass of Untangle enters definitions from the outline into the
**Tangle Symbol Table**, or TST. The second pass simultaneously updates all
sections in the outline whose definition in the TST does not match the
definition in the UST. The central coding insight of the Untangle command is
this:  **the second pass of Untangle is almost identical to the first pass of
Tangle**. That is, Tangle and Untangle share key parts of code, namely the
skip_body method and its allies. Just when skip_body enters a definition
into the symbol table, all the information is present that Untangle needs to
update that definition.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.268">Leo uses unicode objects in vnodes and tnodes to denote headline and body text.
Note that unicode strings have no encoding; only plain strings have encodings.
This means that once an (encoded) plain string has been converted to a unicode
string it doesn't matter how the unicode string was created. This is the key
that makes Leo's new code robust: internally Leo never has to worry about
encodings. Encoding matter only when encoded strings are converted to and from
Unicode. This happens when Leo reads or writes files.

Python expressions that mix unicode strings u and plain strings s, like one of these::

	u + s
	u == s
	u[5] == s[2:]

are promoted to unicode objects using the "system encoding". This encoding
should never be changed, but we can't assume that we know what it is, so for
safety we should assume the most restrictive encoding, namely "ascii". With this
assumption, Leo's code can't throw an exception during these promotions provided
that: 

- All strings are converted to unicode when Leo reads files or gets text from Tk.Text widgets.

- All string literals in Leo's code have only ascii characters.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.269">Unlimited undo is straightforward; it merely requires that all commands that
affect the outline or body text must be undoable. In other words, everything
that affects the outline or body text must be remembered. We may think of all
the actions that may be Undone or Redone as a string of beads (undo nodes).

Undoing an operation moves backwards to the next bead; redoing an operation moves
forwards to the next bead. A bead pointer points to the present bead. The bead
pointer points in front of the first bead when Undo is disabled. The bead
pointer points at the last bead when Redo is disabled. An undo node is a Python
dictionary containing all information needed to undo or redo the operation. The
Undo command uses the present bead to undo the action, then moves the bead
pointer backwards.

The Redo command uses the bead after the present bead to redo the action, then
moves the bead pointer forwards. All undoable operations call setUndoParams() to
create a new bead. The list of beads does not branch; all undoable operations
(except the Undo and Redo commands themselves) delete any beads following the
newly created bead. I did not invent this model of unlimited undo.
I first came across it in the documentation for Apple's Yellow Box classes.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.27">A cloned node is a copy of a node that changes when the original changes. Not
only are changes maintained across all the the clones of a node, changes to its
offspring (children, grandchildren, etc). are simultaneously made to the
corresponding offspring of all of those clones. A small red arrow in the icon
box marks cloned nodes. There is no real distinction between the "original" node
and any of its clones. This makes it possible to update any of the clones and
the original node will change as well. A cloned nodes becomes a regular node
again when its penultimate clone is deleted. Clones are useful for making
alternate views of a program. See `Clones and views`_ for full details.</t>

<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.282">To convert an @root tree to an @file tree, choose the root of the tree to be
converted, then do the following in the Python window::

	import c2py
	c2py.leo1to2()

This script makes numerous changes throughout the tree. It does not, however,
change @root to @file, or insert the needed @others directives. You must do that
by hand.

To convert @root trees to @file trees by hand:

1. Change the @root node to an @file node. That is, delete the @root &lt;filename&gt;
    from the body text and insert @file &lt;filename&gt; in the headline. Typically,
    the root node contains a reference like &lt;&lt;methods of class x&gt;&gt; as the last
    body text. Replace this reference with the @others directive. The expansion
    of @others is all text that is not part of a section definition.

2. Add @ to the start of all doc parts. Leo starts syntax coloring in code mode
   rather than doc mode, so if a doc part starts body text it should start with
   an '@' sign.
   
3. Replace all section definition lines (like &lt;&lt;name&gt;&gt;=) by @c. This results in
   the node being added to the expansion of @others.

4. Remove all unused code from the @file tree. Leo does not write external files
   whose @file trees contain orphan or @ignore nodes.

5. Make sure that all nodes defining a section have a headline that starts with
   &lt;&lt;section&gt;&gt;. This will typically be true when converting @root trees that use
   the @code directive.

6. If a section is referenced in more than one node (a rare occurrence in my
    code), clone the defining node and move one clone under each referencing
    node.

7. If a node contains the definitions of several sections, place each different
   definition in a different node.

    As a precaution against mistakenly defining a section in more than one place,
    it is invalid to use @code in different nodes to define multiple parts for the same section.

<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.336">Errors while writing @file nodes are harmless.
No information is lost because all information is written to the .leo file rather than the external file.

bad @delims directive
    A node contains an ill-formed @delims directive.

    The body text of *headline* contains an @ignore directive.

<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.351">The following bugs can not be fixed:

1.  The Untangle command has no way of updating a section whose name has been changed in the external file.

    Because of the @unit directive, there is not even a way to issue a meaningful warning.

2.  The Tangle command treats @c like @code in CWEB mode.

    I recommend changing @c to @&lt; c @&gt;= throughout your CWEB sources
    and adding a reference to @&lt; c @&gt; in all roots of CWEB files.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.354">Leo uses unicode internally for all strings.

1.  Leo converts headline and body text to unicode when reading .leo files and external files.
    Both .leo files and external files may specify their encoding.  The default is utf-8.
    If the encoding used in a external file is not "utf-8" it is represented in the @+leo sentinel line.
    For example::

        #@+leo-encoding=iso-8859-1.

    The utf-8 encoding is a "lossless" encoding (it can represent all unicode code points),
    so converting to and from utf-8 plain strings will never cause a problem.
    When reading or writing a character not in a "lossy" encoding,
    Leo converts such characters to '?' and issues a warning. 

2.  When writing .leo files and external files Leo uses the same encoding used to read the file,
    again with utf-8 used as a default.

3.  leoSettings.leo contains the following Unicode settings, with the defaults as shown::

        default_derived_file_encoding = UTF-8 
        new_leo_file_encoding = UTF-8 

    These control the default encodings used when writing external files and .leo files.
    Changing the new_leo_file_encoding setting is not recommended.
    See the comments in leoSettings.leo.
    You may set default_derived_file_encoding to anything that makes sense for you.

4.  The @encoding directive specifies the encoding used in a external file.
    You can't mix encodings in a single external file.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.357">This technical information may be of use to those wanting to process Leo files with special-purpose filters.
Leo's uses XML for its file format.
The following sections describe this format in detail.
**Important**:
The actual read/write code in leoFileCommands.py is the authoritative guide.
When in doubt about what Leo actually writes, look at an actual .leo file in another editor.

Here are the elements that may appear in Leo files.
These elements must appear in this order.

&lt;?xml&gt;
    Leo files start with the following line::

        &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;?xml-stylesheet&gt;
    An xml-stylesheet line is option.  For example::

        &lt;?xml-stylesheet ekr_stylesheet?&gt;

&lt;leo_file&gt;
    The &lt;leo_file&gt; element opens an element that contains the entire file.
    &lt;/leo_file&gt; ends the file.

&lt;leo_header&gt; 
    The &lt;leo_header&gt; element specifies version information and other information
    that affects how Leo parses the file.  For example::

        &lt;leo_header file_format="2" tnodes="0" max_tnode_index="5725" clone_windows="0"/&gt;

    The file_format attribute gives the 'major' format number.
    It is '2' for all 4.x versions of Leo.
    The tnodes and clone_windows attributes are no longer used.
    The max_tnode_index	attribute is the largest tnode index.

&lt;globals&gt;
    The globals element specifies information relating to the entire file.
    For example::

        &lt;globals body_outline_ratio="0.50"&gt;
            &lt;global_window_position top="27" left="27" height="472" width="571"/&gt;
            &lt;global_log_window_position top="183" left="446" height="397" width="534"/&gt;
        &lt;/globals&gt;

    -   The body_outline_ratio attribute specifies the ratio of the height of the body pane to
        the total height of the Leo window.
        It initializes the position of the splitter separating the outline pane from the body pane.

    -   The global_window_position and global_log_window_position elements
        specify the position of the Leo window and Log window in global coordinates:

&lt;preferences&gt;
    This element is vestigial.
    Leo ignores the &lt;preferences&gt; element when reading.
    Leo writes an empty &lt;preferences&gt; element.

&lt;find_panel_settings&gt;
    This element is vestigial.
    Leo ignores the &lt;find_panel_settings&gt; element when reading.
    Leo writes an empty &lt;find_panel_settings&gt; element.

&lt;clone_windows&gt;
    This element is vestigial.
    Leo ignores the &lt;clone_windows&gt; element when reading.
    Leo no longer writes &lt;clone_windows&gt; elements.

&lt;vnodes&gt;
    A single &lt;vnodes&gt; element contains nested &lt;v&gt; elements.
    &lt;v&gt; elements correspond to vnodes.
    The nesting of &lt;v&gt; elements indicates outline structure in the obvious way.

&lt;v&gt;
    The &lt;v&gt; element represents a single vnode and has the following form::

        &lt;v...&gt;&lt;vh&gt;sss&lt;/vh&gt; (zero or more nested v elements) &lt;/v&gt;

    The &lt;vh&gt; element specifies the headline text.
    sss is the headline text encoded with the usual XML escapes.
    As shown above, a &lt;v&gt; element may contain nested &lt;v&gt; elements.
    This nesting indicates outline structure in the obvious way.
    Zero or more of the following attributes may appear in &lt;v&gt; elements::

        t=name.timestamp.n
        a="xxx"

    The t="Tnnn" attribute specifies the tnode associated with this vnode.
    The a="xxx" attribute specifies vnode attributes.
    The xxx denotes one or more upper-case letters whose meanings are as follows::

        C	The vnode is a clone. (Not used in 4.x)
        E	The vnode is expanded so its children are visible.
        M	The vnode is marked.
        T	The vnode is the top visible node.
        V	The vnode is the current vnode.

    For example, a="EM"  specifies that the vnode is expanded and is marked.

    **New in 4.0**:

    -   &lt;v&gt; elements corresponding to @file nodes now contain tnodeList attributes.
        The tnodeList attribute allows Leo to recreate the order in which nodes should appear in the outline.
        The tnodeList attribute is a list of gnx's: global node indices.
        See Format of external files (4.x) for the format of gnx's.

    -   Plugins and scripts may add attributes to &lt;v&gt; and &lt;t&gt; elements.
        See `Chapter 13: Writing plugins`_ for details.

&lt;tnodes&gt;
    A single &lt;tnodes&gt; element contains a non-nested list of &lt;t&gt; elements.

&lt;t&gt;
    The &lt;t&gt; element represents a single tnode and has this form::

        &lt;t tx="Tnnn"&gt;&lt;tb&gt;sss&lt;/tb&gt;&lt;/t&gt;

    The tx attribute is required.
    The t attribute of &lt;v&gt; elements refer to this tx attribute.
    The &lt;tb&gt; element specifies the body text.
    sss is the headline text encoded with the usual XML escapes.

    **New in 4.0**:
    Plugins and scripts may add attributes to &lt;v&gt; and &lt;t&gt; elements.
    See `Chapter 13: Writing plugins`_ for details.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.36">The Insert Node command inserts a new node into the outline. The
Delete Node command deletes a node and all its children.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.37">The Cut Outline, Paste Outline, Copy Outline and Delete Outline commands work on
nodes rather than text. For example, to delete a node, select the node and
choose the Cut Outline or Delete Outline command. The Cut Outline and Copy
Outline commands copy a text representation of the outline to the clipboard.
This representation is the same as Leo's .leo file format with some information
deleted. You may copy this text representation into a body pane (or into any
other text editor) using the Edit:Paste command.

**Warning**: In practice, it is almost always wiser to move clones rather than
cutting or pasting them. Cutting and pasting outlines preserves clones, but the
links between clones only exist within the part of the outline that was pasted.
Therefore, if you are cutting and pasting an outline containing clones it is
best to cut and paste the *entire* outline. Alternatively, you can paste part of
an outline, then delete all clones.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.38">You may drag an node (including all its descendants) from one place to another
in an outline. To start a drag, press the main (left) mouse button while the
cursor is over the icon for a node. The cursor will change to a hand icon. If
you release the mouse button while the hand cursor is above the icon for another
node, Leo will move the dragged node after that node. If you release the mouse
button when the hand cursor is not over an icon, Leo will leave the outline pane
as it is. Leo scrolls the outline pane as the result of mouse-moved events, so
to continue scrolling you must keep moving the mouse.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.380">@language rest</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.39">Leo auto indents unless @nocolor is in effect. Typing a newline
automatically inserts the same leading whitespace present on the previous line.
If Python is the present language, Leo inserts an additional tab if the previous
line ends with a colon.

The default features of Leo's body text derive from the Tk.Text widget,
described at: http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.3/TkCmd/text.htm Not all these features
are found on all platforms.
The following features are derived from the Tk Text widget. Some default
behaviors have been changed because they conflict with other Leo features.

-   Clicking mouse button 1 positions the insertion cursor just before the character
    underneath the mouse cursor, sets the input focus to this widget, and clears any
    selection in the widget. Dragging with mouse button 1 strokes out a selection
    between the insertion cursor and the character under the mouse. 

-   Double-clicking mouse button 1 selects the word under the mouse and
    positions the insertion cursor at the end of the word.

-   The ends of the selection can be adjusted by dragging with mouse button 1 while
    the Shift key is down; this will adjust the end of the selection that was
    nearest to the mouse cursor when button 1 was pressed. 

-   Clicking mouse button 1 with the Control key down will reposition the insertion
    cursor without affecting the selection. 

-   Normal printing characters are inserted at the point of the insertion cursor. 

-   If the mouse is dragged out of the body pane while button 1 is pressed, the
    entry will automatically scroll to make more text visible.

-   Left Arrow and Right Arrow move the cursor one character to the left or right
    and clear any selection in the text.

-   Shift Left or Shift Right move the cursor and extend the selection.

-   Control-Left and Control-Right move the insertion cursor by words,
    and Control-Shift-Left and Control-Shift-Right move the insertion
    cursor by words and also extend the selection.

-   Up Arrow and Down Arrow move the insertion cursor one line up or down and
    clear any selection in the text. 

-   Shift Up and Shift Right move the cursor and extend the selection.

-   Control-Up and Control-Down move the insertion cursor by paragraphs.

-   Control-Shift-Up and Control-Shift-Down move the insertion cursor by
    paragraphs and extend the selection. Control-p and Control-n behave
    the same as Up and Down, respectively. **Note**: by default, Leo
    binds Control-p and control-n to commands.

-   Next (Page Down) and Prior (Page Up) keys move the
    insertion cursor one screen and clear any text selection.

-   Shift Next and Shift Prior move the cursor one screen and extend the selection.

-   Line movement is by text lines terminated by hard returns (newlines), not by
    displayed lines; if a text line is long and wraps across more than one display
    line, then the Up and Down movement will skip the extra wrapped display lines.

-   Home moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of its line and clears any
    selection in the widget.

-   Shift-Home moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the line and extends the selection. 

-   End moves the insertion cursor to the end of the line and clear any selection in
    the widget.

-   Shift-End moves the cursor to the end of the line and extends the selection. 

-   Control-Home moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the text and clears
    any selection in the widget.

-   Control-Shift-Home moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the text and extends the selection. 

-   Control-End moves the insertion cursor to the end of the text and clears any
    selection.

-   Control-Shift-End moves the cursor to the end of the text and extends the selection. 

-   Select and Control-Space set the selection anchor to the position of the
    insertion cursor. They don't affect the current selection.

-   Shift-Select and Control-Shift-Space adjust the selection to the current position of the
    insertion cursor, selecting from the anchor to the insertion cursor if there was
    no previous selection. 

-   Control-/ selects the entire contents of the widget. 

-   Control-\ clears any selection in the widget. 

-   F16  (Copy on many Sun workstations) or Control-c copies the
    selection in the widget to the clipboard, if there is a selection.

-   F20 (Cut on many Sun workstations) or Control-x copies the
    selection in the widget to the clipboard and deletes the selection.
    These keys have no effect if no text is selected.

-   F18 (Paste on many Sun workstations) or Control-v inserts the
    contents of the clipboard at the position of the insertion cursor.

-   Delete deletes the text selection, or the character to the right of the cursor
    if there is no text selection.

-   Backspace deletes the selection, or character to the left of the cursor
    if there is no text selection.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.40">You can expand or contract a node by clicking in the standard Windows Tree
View icon to the left of the status icon. Expanding a node shows its immediate
children; contracting a node hides all its children. The Expand All Subheads
command expands all of a nodes offspring (children, grandchildren, etc.)</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.41">Leo auto indents body text following colons when @language Python is in
effect. When the smart_auto_indent setting is True, Leo uses Emacs-style
auto-indentation instead. This style of auto-indent aligns newly created lines
with unmatched ( [ or { brackets in the previous line.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.43">You can mark nodes in several ways:

- With the Mark commands.

- With the Find or Change commands.

- With the Untangle command.

The Go To Next Marked command selects the next marked node, if any.
The Mark command unmarks the selected headline if it is already marked.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.44">The Move Up, Move Down, Move Left and Move Right commands move the currently
selected node. The Promote command makes all the children of a node
siblings of the node. The Demote command makes all following siblings of a
node children of the node.

You can cut and paste any part of a tree. If a node contains selected text,
the cut, copy, clear or paste operation affects only the selected text.
Otherwise, the cut, copy, clear or paste operations acts on the node and all
nodes contained by it. For example, you can move a node by cutting it,
selecting another location in the outline and pasting the node in the new
location.

**Warning**: In practice, it is almost always wiser to move clones rather than
cutting or pasting them. Cutting and pasting outlines preserves clones, but the
links between clones only exist within the part of the outline that was pasted.
Therefore, if you are cutting and pasting an outline containing clones it is
best to cut and paste the _entire_ outline. Alternatively, you can paste part of
an outline, then delete all clones. 
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.45">Double-clicking the icon box of a node whose headline has the form::

    @url &lt;any url&gt;

executes the url in your default web browser.

Leo checks that the url is valid before doing so. A valid url is:

-   3 or more lowercase alphas
-   followed by one :
-   followed by one or more of:
-   $%&amp;'()*+,-./0-9:=?@A-Z_a-z{}~
-   followed by one of: $%&amp;'()*+/0-9:=?@A-Z_a-z}~

Url's should contain no spaces: use %20 to indicate spaces. You may use any
type of url that your browser supports: http, mailto, ftp, file, etc.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.47">You can change the relative sizes of the outline and body panes by dragging the
splitter bar. The Equal Sized Panes command resizes the panes so that each
fills half of the main window.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.48">Leo supports unlimited undo for all typing and all commands. The
'undo_granularity' setting controls the granularity of undo. There are four
possible values:

node
    Starts a new undo unit when typing moves to a new node.

line (default)
    Starts a new undo unit when typing moves to new line.

word
    Starts a new undo unit when typing starts a new word.

char (not recommended)
    Starts a new undo unit for each character typed.
    This wastes lots of computer memory.

setUndoTypingParams calls recognizeStartOfTypingWord to recognize the
start of words. Plugins can modify recognizeStartOfTypingWord. It should
return True if the typing indicated by the params starts a new 'word' for the
purposes of undo with 'word' granularity. setUndoTypingParams calls this
method only when the typing could possibly continue a previous word. In other
words, undo will work safely regardless of the value returned. See the actual
code for recognizeStartOfTypingWord for more details.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.92">An @asis tree is a tree whose root headline starts with @asis &lt;filename&gt;.  Similarly, for @noref and @nosent trees.

New in 4.2:  The following terms are equivalent.  The first form is preferred in each case.

@asis, @file-asis, @silent
@nosent, @file-nosent and @nosentinelsfile
@noref, @file-noref and @rawfile

You can get any combination of sentinels/no sentinels and references/no references using @file, @nosent, @noref and @asis trees:

                External files        Sections and 
Type of tree   contain sentinels?   @others expanded?
------------   ------------------   -----------------
       @asis   no                   no
       @file   yes                  yes
      @noref   yes                  no
     @nosent   no                   yes
     
       

Leo can not update the outline from changes made from external files unless those
files contain sentinels. The primary source for @nosent and @asis trees are the
outlines from which those files were derived.

Leo creates files derived from @noref and @asis trees by writing the body text
of all nodes of the tree in outline order. Leo writes the body text _as is_,
without recognizing section definitions, without expanding section references,
and without treating directives specially in any way. In particular, Leo copies
all directives, including @space or @c directives, to the external file as text.
However, Leo recognizes the @ignore directive in the _ancestors_ of @noref or
@asis nodes, so you may use the @ignore directive as usual to prevent Leo from
writing @rawfile and @silentfile trees.

Notes:

1. When writing @noref trees, Leo writes only the @+leo, @-leo, @+node, @-node,
@+body and @-body sentinels.

2. Within @asis trees only, if a headline starts with @@, Leo writes everything
in the headline following the @@ just before the corresponding body text.

3. Files derived from @asis trees contain _nothing_ not contained in body text
(or @@ headlines). In particular, if body text does not end in a newline, the
first line from the next node will concatenated to the last line of the
preceding node.</t>

<t tx="EKR.20040601084317">Leo 4.2 alpha 3           June 1, 2004

This version fixes completes the essential features of version 4.2. All known
incompletions and bugs involving shared nodes and Leo's new file format have
been fixed. BTW, this version of Leo completes Leaps 201 and 202.

It should be safe to use this version for collaboration between Leo's
developers. I hereby encourage people to start using cvs for collaboration. Only
by doing so will we discover any possible problems.

The only item that must be completed before releasing 4.2 beta is fixing the Go
To Line Number command so it supports thin external files.

There are many known bugs in this version: most are minor bugs that have been
around for a long time. All known bugs will be fixed by the first release
candidate. See the to-do list in LeoPy.leo for the complete list.

The highlights of this version:

- All features of @file-thin are now complete and appear to be stable. - All
	.leo files in the distribution use @thin files where possible. - Leo ignores
	all directives within the range of the @all directive. - The @+middle and
	@-middle sentinels allow sections to be defined in any descendant node. -
	The @clone sentinel marks duplicate cloned siblings. - The beginnings of a
	new undo scheme are in place. - @thin, @nosent, @noref and @asis are
	abbreviations for @file-thin, @file-nosent, @file-noref and @file-asis. -
	Created new iterators that return lists of vnodes and tnodes, including
	iterators that remove all duplicates from those lists.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040601084317.102">Added u.registerUndoHandlers.

This will become largely unnecessary in the new undo scheme.  It's good to have though.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040601084317.142">When writing .leo files Leo now pickle's and hexlify's all data in the
v.unknownAttribute and t.unknownAttribute dictionaries. When reading .leo files
Leo does the reverse.

Leo ignores all elements in these dictionaries if some element can not be pickled.</t>

Leo 4.2 beta 1           June 30, 2004

The highlights of 4.2 beta 2:

- Leo now writes the entire contents of @ignore'd @thin trees to the .leo file.
This change ensures that users can create and remove @ignore directives without
any chance of losing data inadvertently.

- Leo now saves and restores marks and the expansion state of nodes in @thin trees.

- Leo marks @thin nodes as dirty whenever they become "newly unignored", i.e.,
when an @thin node no longer falls in the range of an @ignore directive.

Beta 1 completes all fundamental work in the 4.2 code base. All essential code
is complete. Dozens of bugs have been fixed since the Alpha 3 release about a
month ago.

Known bugs in 4.2 beta 2:

- Not all plugins work correctly.
- Some plugins leak memory very slightly.

The highlights of Leo 4.2:

- @thin trees make Leo much more friendly to cvs. Files derived from @thin can
be committed to cvs and updated from cvs without having to commit or update the
corresponding .leo file. There is no longer any need to keep .leo files and
external files in synch.

- Leo's data structures have been reorganized. As a result, all outline
operations are much faster. To support this organization, scripts that traverse
Leo's data structures must now use a positions rather than vnodes. Old scripts
that appear to use vnodes will still work because methods like c.currentVnode
that appear to return vnodes actually return positions.

Other features of 4.2:

- Leo is now much more friendly to using spaces instead of tabs.
- The Execute Script command reports erroneous lines more clearly.
- The usual assortment of bug features and minor features.

Coming soon in 4.2:

- Perfect Import will guarantee that Leo imports file perfectly.
- @import will allow you to study files using Leo without changing those files.</t>

The Leo icon can eliminate the need for the word Leo.

What I did:

- Eliminate Leo in name of Find panel.
- Derived leoTkinterPrefs from leoTkinterDialog: creates icon.
- Derived leoComparePanel from leoTkinterDialog: creates icon.
- Eliminated the -t option when opening Idle: the idle window is now called "Python Shell"</t>

- Fixed bug in g.scanDirectives that was rejecting negative tabwidth values.
	- This bug did not exist in the other versions of scanDirectives.

- With a negative tabwidth, a backspace now computes what spaces are equivalent
to a tab and delete all of those. This is easy to do!

- Leo calls g.enableIdleTimeHook at end of startup code.
	- This means that g.idleTimeHookHandler gets called periodically, even if no hooks have been defined.
	- g.enableIdleTime hook now calls g.app.gui.setIdleTimeHook at most once.

- app.forceShutdown now calls "end1" hook before calling app.finishQuit.
	- This ensures that the "end1" hook always gets called once.
	- app.finishQuit calls doHook("end1",...) only if it hasn't been called before.
		- This isn't necessary, but it makes traces in doHook less confusing.

- idleTimeHookHandler now calls the idle-time hook for all open windows.
	- So having multiple windows open should not affect idle-time hooks.

** Warning: new convention required to workaround apparent Tk problems.
	- "idle" hooks should return if g.app.killed is True.</t>

- Return "break" after the "final" text has been computed if nothing has changed.

A new idea:  Make sure the text _does_ have a newline at all times.  I'm not sure this will work...

<t tx="EKR.20040628095213.485">There was a small hole in the format of external files. Leo assumed that comment
delimiters do not change within any particular external file. This assumption is
not necessarily true in files like leoProjects.txt.

What I did:

- putDirective and readDirective now check for @langauge and @comment, and
change comment delims appropriately.

This is slightly dubious: after all, an @langauge directive in the middle of
most external files will cause havoc. However, one could say that this is the
users problem :-)

BTW, this doesn't really solve all problems in @all trees: Leo can still get
mightily confused about comment delims if the user doesn't put proper @language
directives in @all trees.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040628095213.490">readEndNode uses the existing tempBodyString attribute to determine if the body text has changed.  If so, we mark the tnode dirty.  The code in 

top_df.read.&lt;&lt; copy all tempBodyStrings to tnodes &gt;&gt;

propagates the dirty marks to all ancestor @file nodes.  This can't be done in readEndNode because no positions are available at that time.</t>

<t tx="EKR.20040628095213.501">Leo now writes t.unknownAttributes to the .leo file when writing the &lt;v&gt; element
corresponding to the root of an @thin tree. Leo will do this by writing a new
xml attribute, descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes, in &lt;v&gt; element.

Leo will only write t.unknownAttributes, not v.unknownAttributes. This is
because only tnodes have gnx's in thin external files. In effect, vnodes are
anonymous. We could attempt to get around this by identifying vnodes by their
corresponding tnodes, but that's not a general solution and it is, in effect,
equivalent to writing only t.unknownAttributes. This being so, it seems
pointless to "pretend" to be writing v.unknownAttributes.

The effect of this is to make all vnodes identical, as far as using
unknownAttributes is concerned. As I've stated in the past, this won't do if,
for example, a plugin is trying create an arbitrary directed graph between
vnodes. In that case, the plugin should confine itself to @file trees, or just
vnodes in .leo files, for that matter.</t>

<t tx="TL.20080804095315.9">If you use the open-with plugin to open node text in Vim and your Vim's "tag"
file refers to external files then there is a risk that a external file that is
initially displayed via the "tag" command" in Vim is accidentally edited and
saved from the external Vim editor while your Leo session still contains the
external file's original text that may later recreate the original external file
during a Leo save operation (overwriting the changes saved from the Vim editor).

To prevent this problem, modifications to external files can be avoided by using
Vim's "modeline" feature to disable editing of external files.

Vim's "modeline" feature scans each loaded buffer for text at the top or bottom
of the file containing " vim:" followed by a series of Vim options. The text is
usually embedded within a comment. The following example prevents modifications
to a buffer in a Python file::

    # vim:noma (A space is required between the '#' and "vim:noma")

If this line is placed in a separate Leo node at the top or bottom of the list
of nodes under a external file node (ex: @thin) then any external file saved and
then later loaded into Vim will, by default, not be modifiable. If a derived
file does need to be edited then modifications can be re-enabled on a
file-by-file basis by issuing Vim's ":ma" command while viewing the derived
file.

The number of lines that Vim checks at the top and bottom of the buffer is
configurable. The following Vim command must be placed in the vimrc file to
allow for Leo's trailing sentinel lines::

    set modelines=8

Issue the ":help modeline" command within Vim for the more information about
modelines.</t>
<t tx="TL.20090225194539.1">A Leo plugin that permits the "easy" assignment of scripts to be performed on
double-clicked nodes based on pattern matching.

When a node is double-clicked, the nodeActions plugin checks for a match of the
double-clicked node's headline text with a list of patterns and, if a match
occurs, the script associated with the pattern is executed.

The nodeActions plugin will only pass the double-click event to other plugins
if no pattern match occurred unless overridden by the "&gt;" `pattern directive`__.

__ nA_Directives_

.. _nA_Patterns:

Patterns:
   The patterns are defined in the headlines of sub-nodes of a single
   "nodeActions" node.

   The "nodeActions" node can be located anywhere within the same Leo file as
   the node that will be double-clicked.  For example, a pattern that matches a
   URL and a pattern that matches any python files stored as an @thin derived
   file could be stored under an @settings node as follows::

      @settings
      |
      +- nodeActions
         |
         +- http:\\*
         |
         +- @thin *.py

   __ nA_Directives_

   Pattern matching is performed using python's support for Unix
   shell-style patterns unless overwritten by the "X" `pattern directive`__.
   The following pattern elements are supported::

              * - matches everything
              ? - matches any single character
        [&lt;seq&gt;] - matches any character in &lt;seq&gt;
       [!&lt;seq&gt;] - matches any character **not** in &lt;seq&gt;

   Unix shell-style pattern matching is case insensitive and always starts from
   the beginning of the headline.  For example:

      .. table::

         ======= =========== ==============
         Pattern   Matches   Does not match
         ======= =========== ==============
         \*.py   Abc_Test.py
         .py     .py - Test  Abc_Test.py
         test*   Test_Abc.py Abc_Test.py
         ======= =========== ==============

   To enable a script to run on any type of @file node (@thin, @shadow, ...),
   the pattern can use "@files" at the beginning of the pattern to match on any
   external file type.  For example, the pattern "@files \*.py" will
   match a node with the headline "@thin Abcd.py".

   The headline of the double-clicked node is matched against the patterns
   starting from the first sub-node under the "nodeActions" node to the last
   sub-node.  Only the script associated with the first matching pattern is
   invoked unless overwritten by the "V" `pattern directive`__.

   __ nA_Directives_

   This can be used to define a broad pattern such
   as "@files \*.py", and then, by placing a more restrictive pattern above it,
   such as "@files \*_test.py", a different script can be executed for those
   special cases::

      +- nodeActions
         |
         +- @files *_test.py
         |
         +- @files *.py

   :Note:
      To prevent Leo from trying to save patterns that begin with a derived
      file directive (@thin, @auto, ...) to disk, such as "@thin \*.py",
      place the "@ignore" directive in the body of the "nodeActions" node.

Scripts:
   The script for a pattern is located in the body of the pattern's node.
   The following global variables are available to the script::

      c
      g
      pClicked - node position of the double-clicked node
      pScript - node position of the invoked script

.. _nA_Directives:

Directives:
   The following pattern specific directives can be appended to the end of a
   pattern (do not include the ':'):

   :[X]:
      Use python's regular expression type patterns instead of the Unix
      shell-style pattern syntax.

      For example, the following patterns will match the same headline string::

         Unix shell-style pattern:
            @files *.py

         Regular Expression patern:
            ^@files .*\.py$ [X]

   :[V]:
      Matching the pattern will not block the double-click event from
      being passed to the remaining patterns.
      The "V" represents a down arrow that symbolizes the passing of the event
      to the next pattern below it.

      __ nA_Patterns_

      For example, adding the "[V]" directive to the "@files \*_test.py" in
      the `Patterns`__ section above, changes its script from being 'an
      alternate to' to being 'a pre-processor for' the "@files \*.py" script::

         +- nodeActions
            |
            +- @files *_test.py [V]
            |
            +- @files *.py

   :[&gt;]:
      Matching the pattern will not block the double-click event from being
      passed to other plugins.
      The "&gt;" represents a right arrow that
      symbolizes the passing of the event to the next plugin.

      If the headline matched more than one headline,
      the double-click event will be passed to the next plugin if the
      directive is associated with any of the matched patterns.

   The directive(s) for a pattern must be contained within a single set of
   brackets, separated from the pattern by a space, with or without a comma
   separator.  For example, the following specifies all three directives::

      ^@files .*\.py$ [X,V&gt;]

Configurations:
   The nodeActions plugin supports the following global configurations using
   Leo's support for setting global variables within an @settings node's
   sub-nodes in the leoSettings.leo, myLeoSettings.leo, and the project Leo
   file:

   @bool nodeActions_save_atFile_nodes = False

      :True:
         The nodeActions plugin will save a double-clicked external file node
         to disk, if a pattern match occurred, before executing its script.  

      :False:
         A pattern match to a double-clicked external file node will **not**
         cause the external file to be saved to disk.
         (default)

   @int nodeActions_message_level = 1

      Specifies the type of messages to be sent to the log pane.  Specifying a
      higher message level will display that level and all lower levels.
      The following integer values are supported:

      :0: no messages
      :1: Plugin triggered and the patterns that were matched (default)
      :2: Double-click event passed or not to next plugin
      :3: Patterns that did not match
      :4: Code debugging messages

Script examples:
   Displaying URLs (tested with WinXP):

      Double-clicking on a node with a "http:\\\\www.google.com" headline
      will invoke the script associated with the
      "http:\\\\\*" pattern.  The following script in the body of the pattern's
      node displays the URL in a browser::

         import webbrowser
         hClicked = pClicked.h     #Clicked node's Headline text
         webbrowser.open(hClicked) #Invoke browser

   Executing commands (tested with WinXP):

      The following script can be placed in the body of a pattern's node to
      execute a command in the first line of the body of a double-clicked node::

         g.os.system('"Start /b ' + pClicked.bodyString() + '"')

<t tx="edream.110203163054.100">The Synchronization Principle simplifies everything and at long last puts Leo on
a firm theoretical foundation. This principle states that the "smallest unit of
meaning" of any Leo outline is the entire outline itself. In particular,
individual external files have meaning only in the context of a particular
outline.

The Synchronization Principle has the following happy consequences:

1. We may assume that all external files are in synch with the outline that wrote
them. This assumption allows Leo to use "hidden machinery" in the outline to
associate nodes in the external file with nodes in the outline. This "hidden"
machinery consists of a list of tnodes associated with @file vnodes in the
outline. When writing a external file Leo creates a list of tnodes in the order
they were written to the external file. When reading the external file, Leo uses
this list to associate nodes in the external file with nodes in the outline.

2. external files must get their structure from the .leo file that wrote them. As
we have seen, this is done using the hidden machinery in the .leo file.
Consequently, there is no further need to represent outline structure in derived
files. There is no need any longer either for child indices or for sentinels to
represent outline structure. As a result, we can eliminate @+body and @-body
nodes entirely because all @+node sentinels are followed by body text.

3. All .leo files must contain full outline structure. Even "thin" outline will
contain the full representation of the outline as vnodes.

4. Reading _never_ alters outline structure in the outline. No vnodes are ever
created or destroyed and reading never alters clone links. This is true whether
or not read errors occur. The read code sets a temporary attribute of tnodes
while reading. These attributes are copied to the permanent t.bodyString
attribute only if no read errors were encountered.

4. Error recovery is now trivial: Read errors indicate that the .leo files and
one or more external files are out-of-synch. No error recovery is attempted: the
@file tree in which the error occurred reverts back to its original state.

5. The new Import External File command is the _only_ way to recover data from
mismatched external file.</t>

<t tx="edream.110203163054.102">The write_old_format_derived_files option in leoConfig.leo and leoConfig.txt
determines which format of external file Leo's Write and Save commands write by
default. If this option is 0 (recommended) Leo writes 4.x format external files.
Otherwise Leo writes 3.x external files.

Note that you can use the Write 3.x/4.x external files commands in the
File:Read/Write menu to write external files in an explicitly specified format.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.103">This command deletes all entries in the Recent Files submenu except the most

<t tx="edream.110203163054.104">The Import External File command imports all the nodes in a external file into the
outline. Unlike the read commands, no outline structure is preserved. This
command can import either 3.x or 4.x external files.

This command is necessary in version 4.0 because there is no other way to read
external files that are out-of-synch with a .leo file.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.105">The Write 4.x External Files command and Write 3.x External Files command work
just like the Write @file Nodes command, except that they write the indicated
format off external file. In contrast, the Write @file Nodes command writes 3.x
format external files if and only if the write_old_format_derived_files = 1 in
leoConfig.txt.

All three of these commands automatically save the outline (the .leo file) if
any external file was actually written. This is necessary so that information in
the .leo file always remains in synch with all external files.</t>

<t tx="edream.110203163054.108">Leo's read code now warns if any non-empty node is unvisited. This check, and
the check that headlines match pretty much guarantees that out-of-synch outlines
will generate errors. Thus, there is no need a gnx timestamp in @+leo sentinels!</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.109">Version 4.0 is a major advance in Leo's error handling. Using 4.0 is much safer
than all previous versions. This new error handling applies to all derived
files, both 3.x and 4.x format.

Leo's read code never alters the structure of an outline, regardless of whether
read errors are encountered. This means that clone links, marks, and all other
information in the outline except body text remains completely unchanged during
reads. Broken clone links (the dreaded read errors) are gone forever. Also, the
new read code makes no changes to any body text until it is known that no read
errors have occurred. This ensures that absolutely no changes at all are made to
the outline if there are read errors.

Leo's read code now writes a message to the log pane whenever it sees that the
body text in the external file does not match the body text in the outline. These
messages do not indicate errors, only that the body text has been changed
outside of Leo, say in an external editor or by cvs.</t>

首章 Chapter 1: Installing Leo
##########################################

This chapter tells how to install and run_ Leo.

**Important**:

If you have *any* problems installing Leo,
please ask for help on `Leo's help forum`_.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.49">Leo will work on any platform that supports Python 2.5 or later and Tk 8.4 or later. For
Qt ui, Qt 4.4 or newer (and compatible PyQt) is required.

-   Download the latest version of Leo from `Leo's download page`_.

-   Download Python from: http://python.org/

-   Most installations of Python have Tk pre-installed.
    If your doesn't, you may download it from: http://tcl.activestate.com/software/tcltk/

    **Warning**: When building Tcl on Linux, do **not** specify
    "--enable-threads".
    Only use Tcl with the default "threads not enabled" case.

-   Leo uses `Pmw`_ (Python Mega Widgets). Leo's extensions folder contains a copy
    of Pmw for use if needed. Leo first tries to import Pmw normally. If that
    fails, Leo will use the version of Pmw in the extensions folder.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.50">If you are using Debian/Ubuntu, find and install the debian package. This
provides the best integration with your desktop (file associations, icons, launcher
item). Failing that, follow the instructions below.

Download the latest version of Leo (a .zip file) from `Leo's download page`_.

Unzip the downloaded .zip file into the **unpacked folder** in your home directory.
The unpacked folder will be called something like leo-4-5.

You now have two choices:

1. You can run Leo from your home directory.
   Just add  ~/leo-4-5 to your path.

2. You can install leo into /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/bin by running Leo's install script as follows::

    cd ~/leo-4-4-3-final
    chmod u+x install
    sudo ./install


The install script will instruct you to add /usr/local/bin to your path.
You can, instead, add the following link::

    sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/leo/ /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/

Now you are ready to `run Leo`_.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.61">For versions of Leo before 4.0 and for versions of Python before 2.3,
Leo will draw a Leo icon in Leo windows only if you have installed Fredrik Lundh's PIL and tkIcon packages.

-   Download PIL from http://www.pythonware.com/downloads/index.htm#pil

-   Download tkIcon from http://www.effbot.org/downloads/#tkIcon
</t>

<t tx="edream.110203163054.64">Leo 4.1 alpha 1                   November 3, 2003

*** Alpha quality code:  Please make full backups before playing with this code!

This release marks another significant milestone in Leo's history:

- Leo's 4.x file code is complete. At present I have no plans to change the
format of .leo files or external files. I am eating my own dog food: I do all my
editing with the 4.1 code base.

- Leo uses immutable gnx's (id:timestamp:n) by default to associate tnodes with
vnodes in .leo files. This makes Leo as cvs friendly as possible. From now on
.leo files will be checked in to cvs with the -ko (text/keywords off) option.

- The use_gnx setting in leoConfig.txt determines whether uses gnx's (cvs
friendly) or ints. No version of Leo before 4.1 can read .leo files containing
gnx. Only gnx's are immutable. Leo recomputes all non-gnx indices from scratch
whenever writing a .leo file. It is possible to convert between 3.x and 4.1 file
formats by changing the use_gnx setting.

- The 4.1 code base has been reorganized to support gui's other than tkinter.
Leo's src directory contains several new source files.

- The file test.leo in the test directory contains real regression tests for
syntax coloring. Regression testing scripts create regression tests dynamically
from data in Leo's outline. Very cool, very easy, very general. In particular,
regression tests may use temporary nodes in test.leo rather than creating
separate Tk windows for testing.

Known bugs:

- The Extract commands eat one character too much.

- The __wx_gui.py plugin is only partly functional.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.66">Leo 4.0.4                         October 29, 2003

- Fixed a problem with the titles in Font and Color panels.
- Worked around a Unicode assert failure in the colorizer.
- Fixed crasher in OnEndEditHeadline.
- Fixed import problems in leoPlugins.leo.
- @first and @last sentinels no longer contain corresponding text.
  This fixes a problem that affected PHP comment delimiters.

Leo 4.0.3                         October 25, 2003

- Fixes several problems with the auto_save and plugin menu plugins.
- Fixes a problem with the Go To Line Number command.

Note: This version does _not_ support Unicode file names or directory names.

Leo 4.0.2                         October 23, 2003

- Fixes a crasher in reportBadChars when a .leo file contains a character that
  can not be represented in the encoding specified in the first line of the
  .leo file.
- Leo now sends full tracebacks to the log window when Leo takes an unexpected
 exception.
- Leo now issues a more informative message when the @comment directive
  inhibits the Untangle command.

Leo 4.0.1                         October 22, 2003

- Fixes several crashers, one of which may prevent Leo from starting.
- Fixes indentation for section references that are preceded by something
  other than whitespace.
- Removes debugging traces when reading and writing unknown attributes.
- Removes some improperly cloned nodes from LeoDocs.leo.
- Adds the checkTopologyOfAllClones script.
- Fixes some problems with plugins.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.67">Leo 4.0 final                     October 17, 2003

More than a year in the making, Leo 4.0 is finally here.

Highlights of 4.0 final:
-----------------------

** Improved and simplified format of external files.
	- Eliminated child indices, extraneous blank lines and @body sentinels.
	- Eliminated @node sentinels that indicate outline structure.
	- New @nl and @nonl sentinels indicate where newlines are and aren't.
	- These changes will largely eliminate unwanted cvs conflicts.

** Greatly improved error handling.
	- Reading external files _never_ alter outline structure or links.
	- Read errors leave the outline completely unchanged.
	- Broken clone links are gone forever.
	- As a result, 4.0 is much safer than all previous versions.

** Full compatibility will previous versions of Leo.
	- Leo 4.0 reads all external files properly, regardless of version.
	- Leo writes new-format external files by default, and this default may be changed.
	- New commands in the read/write menu allow you to explicitly specify the format of external files.

* New commands:
	- Write 3.x external file and Write 4.x external file.
	- Import External File.
	- Clear Recent Files.

* Dozens of other improvements, including:
	- Better Unicode support.
	- New configuration settings.
	- Several new plugins.

<t tx="edream.110203163054.68">Leo 4.0 beta 4                      October 13, 2003

This is the third public release of Leo 4.0. There are no known serious bugs in
this version of Leo.  This will be the last beta release before 4.0 final.

Changes made in 4.0 beta 4
--------------------------

- Changed all instances of string.letters to string.ascii_letters.
  string.letters can cause crashes in some locales (Unicode environments).
- Fixed several bugs that caused clone marks not to be set properly.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.69">Leo 4.0 beta 3                      October 9, 2003

This is the third public release of Leo 4.0. There are no known serious bugs in
this version of Leo.

Highlights of 4.0 beta 3
------------------------

- Fixed problems with setting Leo's window icons.
- Plugins may now save their own information in &lt;v&gt; and &lt;t&gt; elements in .leo files.
- The usual assortment of bug fixes and minor improvements.

See the children of this node for full details.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.70"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.71">This was a long-standing bug.  It's effect was cosmetic, and it was important to fix.</t>

<t tx="edream.110203163054.76">Leo can now read and write "foreign" attributes in &lt;v&gt; and &lt;t&gt; elements in .leo
files:

- When reading a .leo file, Leo will create t.unknownAttributes or
v.unknownAttributes ivars for any tnode and vnode object whose corresponding &lt;v&gt;
or &lt;t&gt; element in the .leo file contains a foreign attribute.

- The unknownAttributes ivars are a dictionary whose keys are the attribute
names and whose values are strings.

- When writing a file, Leo will write "foreign" attributes if a vnode or tnode
contains an unknownAttributes ivar.

- The only "native" attributes that Leo expects to find are the "tx" attribute
in &lt;t&gt; elements and the "a", "t", "vtag" and "tnodeList" attributes of &lt;v&gt;
elements. Everything else is a foreign attribute.

- Leo performs the usual xml escapes on these strings when reading or writing
the unknownAttributes ivars.

Plugins may cause Leo to write such foreign attributes simply by attaching
unknownAttributes ivars to a vnode or tnode. For example:

	v.unknownAttributes = {"vnodeIcon" : pathToIcon}

It would be best not to delete other foreign attributes, so the following would
be preferred:

	if hasattr(v,"unknownAttributes"):
		v.unknownAttributes["vnodeIcon"] = pathToIcon
	else:
		v.unknownAttributes = {"vnodeIcon" : pathToIcon}

Another way:

	try:
		v.unknownAttributes["vnodeIcon"] = pathToIcon
	except AttributeError:
		v.unknownAttributes = {"vnodeIcon" : pathToIcon}</t>

This is the second public release of Leo 4.0. There are no known serious bugs
in this version of Leo. Version 4.0 is the culmination of over a year of
collaborative design work and several months of actual implementation.

Highlights of 4.0 beta 2
------------------------
* Fixed several bugs:
  - Fixed several problems with reading and writing 4.0 external files.
  - Fixed several Unicode-related bugs.
  - Fixed a crasher in the Go To Line Number command.
  - Fixed a problem with Importing Python files.
* Important improvements:
  - Added allow_clone_drags setting.  N.B. Allows Leo to be used with Aqua.
  - When running Python 2.3 Leo can now create window icons without third-party packages.
- The usual minor improvements and bug fixes.

Scripts are executed in a "pristine" environment, that is, with __builtins__ as
both the local and global environments.

New in version 4.1: Body text may now contain @directives and section
references. This is a major step forward: you can now use all of Leo's features
to organize scripts that you execute interactively.

Section definitions must appear in the node containing the script or in
descendant nodes. Leo "preprocesses" all scripts by simulating the writing of a
external file to a string.

The Execute Script command sets app.scriptDict["script1"] to the value of the
script before preprocessing, and sets app.scriptDict["script2"] to the value of
the script after preprocessing. Scripts may examine and change app.scriptDict as
they please.</t>

This is the fifth release of the reorganized 4.1 code base.

For the first time in months there are no serious bugs outstanding.

Warning: By default Leo 4.1 creates .leo files that can not be read by older versions of Leo.

Warning: Use the __wx_gui.py plugin with extreme caution until further notice:
bugs in this plugin could cause body text to be cleared improperly when changing nodes.

Beta 5:
  * Leo runs in batch mode when invoked with --script aScriptFile.py
    - Created "null gui" classes that do not use any gui code.
  * Leo supports Unicode characters (e.g. Chinese) in path and file names.
  * Fixed several long-standing bugs:
    - Fixed several minor problems with the Extract Section and Import commands.
    - Fixed problem that prevent the Find panel from working on the Mac.
    - Improved @url handling so that @url file:\\path\x.leo works properly.
    - Improved support for @lineending platform.
    - Leo honors outline/body pane ratio when opening .leo files.
    - Leo now ensures that newly-opened windows fit entirely on the screen.
    - Fixed a crasher when Undoing a Change All command when searching headlines.
  - Fixed other bugs resulting from the 4.1 reorg:
    - Fixed problem loading plugins on Linux.
    - Fixed crashers in the Extract Section and Extract commands.
    - Fixed a crasher when writing a file containing an undefined section.
    - Removed duplicate bindings in popup menus.
    - Made sure to show Leo's windows in wx gui plugin.

Beta 4:
  - Fixed several "reorg" bugs, some of which affected plugins.
  - Allow @directives and section references when executing scripts!
  - More than one section reference may now appear on the same line.
  - Use "utf-8" encoding for filenames under MacOS (Darwin)
  - Allow command or cmnd prefix for menu shortcuts under Darwin.
	  
Beta 3:
  - Completed the reorg, making many changes to the code base.
  - Fixed a LaTeX coloring bug

Beta 2:
  - Fixed a startup problem on Linux: the "mbcs" text encoding is not valid on Linux.

Beta 1:
  * Script-based find/change commands.
  - Hoist &amp; DeHoist commands for viewing parts of an outline.
  - Check Outline command finds user clone mistakes.
  * New configuration settings:
    - use_gnx specifies whether .leo files use integers as indices:
      use_gnx = 0 makes .leo files compatible with previous versions of Leo.
      use_gnx = 1 makes .leo files cvs-friendly
    - config_encoding specifies the encoding of leoConfig.txt.
  * Several significant code-level changes:
    - The 4.1 code base has been reorganized to support gui plugins.
    - An example wx_gui plugin is partly functional.
    - Created a flexible framework for creating &amp; running regression tests.

New in 4.1: Leo now supports scripts in Leo's Find/Change dialog.

Leo's find panel now contains the Script Search radio button and the Script
Change checkbox. When the Script Search radio button is selected Leo treats the
contents of the Search Text as a script to execute whenever any kind of Find
command is executed. Similarly, when the Script Change checkbox is selected Leo
treats the context of the Change Text as a script to execute whenever any kind
of Change command is executed. See below for just how this works.

Script-based find-change is extremely powerful. In effect, Leo's Find/Change
panel becomes a new platform for running scripts interactively. Leo now has all
the find/change capability of pattern matching languages like Snobol and Icon,
just by using the capabilities of the plain Python language. Moreover, Leo can
deliver these capabilities interactively or not depending which buttons you push
in Leo's Find/Change panel.

Script-based find/change frees the user from having to control script-based
searches interactively. Rather than forcing find/change scripts to implement
their own interactive controls, it is much easier to use what Leo already has.</t>

<t tx="edream.111803060152"></t>
<t tx="edream.111803060152.1">Leo dedicates a Python dictionary called app.searchDict for communication
between Leo and the search and change scripts. The search and change scripts may
also use app.searchDict for communication between themselves. Leo sets
app.searchDict["type"] to "find", "change", "findAll" or "changeAll" to indicate
the kind of command being executed. Scripts may use all other entries in
app.searchDict as they please.

Leo executes the find script once when you press the Find button (or the Change
then Find button) in Leo's Find/Change dialog. Typically, the find script would
traversing the tree and highlight the found text or otherwise indicate to the
user that the find operation has succeeded. However, the script can do anything
it pleases.

Leo executes the the find script repeatedly when you press the Find All button.
Leo keeps executing the find script until app.searchDict["continue"] evaluates
to false. Initially there is no entry for app.searchDict["continue"], so the
find script must set app.searchDict["continue"] = true if it wants Leo to keep
executing it.

Leo executes the change script once when you press the Change button. Typically,
the change script would change the selected text. Usually the change script will
compute the new value of body text and call c.setBodyString(p,newText) to
make that change permanent. 

The change script also may handle undo, typically by calling
c.frame.onBodyChanged(v,"Change",oldText=oldText). Leo does not handle undo
automatically. Indeed, Leo makes no assumptions whatever about what the change
script really does.

Leo executes the the change script repeatedly when you press the Change All
button. Just as with the Find All command, Leo keeps executing the change script
until app.searchDict["continue"] evaluates to false.

Most find and change scripts will ignore settings in the Find Panel like "whole
word", "pattern match", and "reverse". However, these settings are available to
the scripts via ivars such as c.whole_word_flag, etc. if desired.</t>
<t tx="edream.111803060152.2">@nocolor

Some ideas for using scripts:
	
Either the find and change scripts may use Python's re module.  For
example, the find script could set app.searchDict["m"] to the match object
returned by re's match method.  The change script would then compute the
result, change the text and set the undo info as usual.

There is no reason to confine find/change scripts to operate on data only
within a Leo outline. These scripts could as easily traverse your file system
as the Leo outline. But notice: scripts could pull data from the file system
into the outline so that you can see the effects of changes as the scripts
operate. Again, this can all happen interactively if you like.</t>

@  New in version 4.1: On startup, Leo looks for two arguments of the form --script scriptFile.  If found, Leo enters batch mode.

In batch mode Leo does not show any windows.  Leo assumes the scriptFile contains a Python script and executes the contents of that file using Leo's Execute Script command.  By default, Leo sends all output to Leo's log pane to the console window.  Scripts in the scriptFile may disable or enable this output by calling app.log.disable() or app.log.enable()

Scripts in the scriptFile may execute any of Leo's commands except the Edit Body and Edit Headline commands.  Those commands require interaction with the user.

For example, the following batch script reads a Leo file and prints all the headlines in that file.
@c

import leoGlobals as g

path = r"c:\prog\leoCVS\leo\test\test.leo"

g.app.log.disable() # disable reading messages while opening the file
flag,newFrame = g.openWithFileName(path,None)
g.app.log.enable() # re-enable the log.

The Scripts node in LeoPy.leo contains a script called initScriptFind.  This script makes it easy to set up script based searches as follows:

1. Put the following code in the root of a tree that will contain your script search:

@color
# Initialize Leo's find panel using the named children of this node.
from leoGlobals import *
initScriptFind("Find script","Change script") # Second argument is optional.
# Start searching at the top.
top().selectVnode(c.rootVnode())
@nocolor

2. Put the search script in a child node called "Find script" (no quotes).

3. (Optional) Put the change script in a child node called "Change script"

4.  Execute the code above.  Leo does the following:

- Puts the body of the "Find script" into the find text of Leo's Find/Change dialog.
- Puts the body of the "Change script" into the change text of Leo's Find/Change dialog.
- Selects the Script Find radio button.
- Selects the Script Change checkbox if the change script exists.
- Selects the root of the entire outline.

Presto!  Leo is ready for a script search.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20040201114855.13">Adds a quick search to the toolbar in Leo.

A search box which behaves like a web site search is added, along with a "GO"
button to do quick searches right from the main Leo window. All the current
search options are retained except that "search body text" is explicitly set -
mainly because this is by far the most common use case.

Pressing &lt;CR&gt; while editing the text automatically does a search. Repeated
searches can be done by clicking the "GO" button.

The combo box also stores a list of previous searches, which can be selected to
quickly repeat a search. When activating a previous search the original search
mode is used.

Still to do:

- incremental search
- reverse search
- persist recent searches across Leo sessions
- use INI file to set options for list size, etc.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040201114855.29">Adds a node navigator to the toolbar. The navigator allows quick access to
marked nodes. You can either go to the marked node or hoist the marked node.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040201114855.3">This plugin uses Leo and docutils to mix program code and reST documentation.

The Python docutils package must be installed.http://docutils.sourceforge.net

If SilverCity is installed (http://silvercity.sourceforge.net) the plugin
produces HTML output that is syntax colored.

The basic approach is that any Leo node that contains program code that needs
documentation (in an ideal world it would be every node) has an associated child
node whose headline is simply '@rst', that contains reST-style documentation.
While this means that a typical program may have dozens (if not hundreds) of
these @rst nodes, it produces documentation that I think is as close as I have
ever seen to useful, easy-to-read documentation that is easy to create at the
same time as an application is being coded.

There are several interrelated aspects to this work:

- The reST plugin (renamed rst2) was hacked to manage Leo outlines that were a
combination of normal code nodes and reSt nodes.

- The plugin now recognizes a @rst directive (that has no associated file name)
in the headline of a node.

- When it encounters such a @rst Headline node, it writes the contents of the
body of the @rst node's *parent* (which generally contains program code) to the
reST output file (HTML) and then adds the reST content that is contained in the
body of the @rst documentation node to the output HTML file,

- These @rst nodes are used in @file-nosent trees and the @rst nodes have an 
@ignore directive (plus @nocolor directive and @wrap directives) so that 
when the @file is updated the application code does not contain the reST-style
documentation contained in the body of the @rst nodes. (This was the reason I
had asked you in the Leo Forum to allow @file-nosent trees to work appropriately
with @ignore nodes - Thank you for doing this right away.) There is no reason
that the reST content couldn't be written to the 
@file as documentation other than I personally believe in a volume of 
documentation (including musings, failed ideas, questions, etc.) that is 
probably best kept separate from the actual *.py files.

- When you double-click on a plain rst node (no associated filename) Leo opens
both the @rst documentation node and the parent node containing code in an
external editor *simultaneously*. I happen to use Textpad and so the code is
opened with python syntax coloring in one Textpad window and right next to it is
the reST documentation. This makes it much much easier to code and do
documentation at the same time. (Note that the plugin assumes that the python
extension is '.tp' since that is what I use with TextPad.)

So why is this a big deal?

For the first time in my experience the documentation process:

1) is completely in sync with the process of code development.

2) allows the programmer to write as much documentation as he/she wants without
the programming code becoming unreadable because of what would be considered
excessive or intrusive documentation. (This applies whether documentation is
intended for external consumption or just so a solo programmer can remember what
he/she was thinking...)

My conclusion is that Leo + reST/docutils provides the perfect platform for
optimal documentation. I have never completely understood what is meant by
Literate Programming but in my mind this is practical Literate Programming.

Frankly, I think this is all a minor miracle but maybe I've lost perspective.

The documentation for encoding lines at

C:\Python23\Doc\Python-Docs-2.3.1\whatsnew\section-encodings.html

states:

"Encodings are declared by including a specially formatted comment in the
first or second line of the source file."

In fact, contrary to the implication, the Python 2.3 parser does not look
for lines of the form:

# -*- coding: &lt;encoding&gt; -*-

For example, Python improperly scans the following line for an encoding

#@+leo-ver=4-encoding=iso-8859-1.

and reports that iso-8859-1. (note trailing dot) is an invalid encoding!

The workaround for my app is to precede this line with the following line:

# -*- coding: iso-8859-1 -*-

This makes Python 2.3 happy.

To make myself perfectly clear: Python has absolutely no right to complain
about comment lines that do not have the form:

Chapter 7: Scripting Leo with Python
####################################

This chapter describes how to write Python scripts that control Leo and access
the data in Leo outlines. To write such scripts, you must understand the basics
of Leo's internal data structures. As we shall see, these basics are quite simple.

Although this chapter discussses everything you will need to write most scripts,
please keep in mind that your scripts have complete access to all of Leo's
source code, that is, all the code in LeoPy.leo.

**Note**: If you are reading this documentation in leoDocs.leo you can execute
all code examples in this chapter by running the Execute Script command
(Ctrl-B). You may have to select the actual code to execute if a node contains

This script makes a list of all the nodes in an outline::

    nodes = list(c.all_positions())
    print("This outline contains %d nodes" % len(nodes))
    
The c.all_unique_positions generator returns a list of all unique positions in the outline.
For each vnode v in the outline, exactly one position p is returned such that p.v == v.

This script prints the *distinct* vnodes of an outline::

    for p in c.all_unique_positions():
        sep = g.choose(p.hasChildren(),'+','-')
        print('%s%s %s' % (' '*p.level(),sep,p.h))

    c.redraw_now()

However, it is usually better to *request* a redraw to be done later as follows::

    c.redraw()

Leo actually redraws the screen in c.outerUpdate, provided that a redraw has been requested.
Leo will call c.outerUpdate at the end of each script, event handler and Leo command.</t>

which calls the "command1" and "command2" hook routines for the given label.
c.doCommand catches all exceptions thrown by the command::

    c.doCommand(c.markHeadline,label="markheadline")

You can also call command handlers directly so that hooks will not be called::

    c.markHeadline()

You can invoke minibuffer commands by name.  For example::

    c.executeMinibufferCommand('open-outline')

c.keyHandler.funcReturn contains the value returned from the command.
In many cases, as above, this value is simply 'break'.</t>

from within scripts.  See leoFindScript.py in LeoPy.leo for full details.

The findall function returns a list of tuples (v,pos) describing matches in
c's entire tree::

    import leo.scripts.leoFindScript as leoFindScript

    pattern="import leo.core.leoGlobals as g"
    result = leoFindScript.findAll(c,pattern,bodyFlag=1)

    print("%-3d instances of: '%s'...\n" % (len(result),pattern),color="purple")

    for v,pos in result:
        body = v.b
        print('\n%-4d %s' % (pos,v.h))
        print(g.get_line_after(body,pos))

The reFindall function returns a list of tuples (v,mo,pos), where mo
is a MatchObject. The reFlags argument are flags to re.search::

    import leo.scripts.leoFindScript as leoFindScript

    pattern="from .* import"
    result = leoFindScript.reFindAll(c,pattern,bodyFlag=1,reFlags=None)

    print("%-3d instances of: '%s'...\n" % (len(result),pattern),color="purple")
    for v,mo,pos in result:

    --script scriptFile

If found, Leo enters batch mode. In batch mode Leo does not show any windows.
Leo assumes the scriptFile contains a Python script and executes the contents of
that file using Leo's Execute Script command. By default, Leo sends all
output to the console window. Scripts in the scriptFile may disable or enable
this output by calling app.log.disable or app.log.enable

Scripts in the scriptFile may execute any of Leo's commands except the Edit Body
and Edit Headline commands. Those commands require interaction with the user.
For example, the following batch script reads a Leo file and prints all the
headlines in that file::

    path = r"c:\prog\leoCVS\leo\test\test.leo"

    g.app.log.disable() # disable reading messages while opening the file
    flag,newFrame = g.openWithFileName(path,None)
    g.app.log.enable() # re-enable the log.

    for p in newFrame.c.all_positions():

    p.moveToNthChildOf(v2,n)  # move p to the n'th child of v2
    p.moveToRoot(oldRoot)     # make p the root position.
                              # oldRoot must be the old root position if it exists.

The "visited" bit may be used by commands or scripts for any purpose.
Many commands use this bits for tree traversal, so these bits do not persist::

    c.clearAllVisited() # Clears all visited bits in c's tree.

    g.redirectStderr() # Redirect stderr to the current log pane.
    g.redirectStdout() # Redirect stdout to the current log pane.
    g.restoreStderr()  # Restores stderr so it prints to the console window.
    g.restoreStdout()  # Restores stdout so it prints to the console window.
    g.stdErrIsRedirected() # Returns True if the stderr stream is redirected to the log pane.
    g.stdOutIsRedirected() # Returns True if the stdout stream is redirected to the log pane.

Calls need *not* be paired. Redundant calls are ignored and the last call made
controls where output for each stream goes.
**Note**: you must execute Leo in a console window to see non-redirected output from the print statement::

    print("stdout isRedirected: %s" % g.stdOutIsRedirected())
    print("stderr isRedirected: %s" % g.stdErrIsRedirected())

    g.redirectStderr()
    print("stdout isRedirected: %s" % g.stdOutIsRedirected())
    print("stderr isRedirected: %s" % g.stdErrIsRedirected())

    g.es(p) # p is already defined.
    p = c.p # get the current position.
    g.es(p)
    g.es("head:",p.h)
    g.es("body:",p.b)

Here is how to access data at position p.
**Note**: these methods work whether or not p is the current position::

    body = p.b # get the body text.
    head = p.h # get the headline text.
    p.b = body # set body text of p to body.
    p.h = head # set headline text of p to head.

**Note**: Sometimes you want to use text that *looks* like a section reference, but isn't.
In such cases, you can use g.angleBrackets.  For example::

    g.es(g.angleBrackets('abc'))</t>

Leo's
generators return positions or nodes, one after another. Generators do not
return lists, but you can make lists from generators easily. For example, the
c.all_positions() generator returns every position in c's tree, one after
another. You can use the generator directly, like this::

    for p  in c.all_positions():
        print(p.h)
        
You can create actual lists from generators in several ways::

    aList = list(c.all_positions()] # Use the list built-in function.
    print(aList)
    
or::

    aList = [p.copy() for p in c.all_positions()] # Use list comprehension.
    print(aList)

    
Using the list is simpler, but list comprehensions can be more flexible.  For example::

    aList = [p.copy().h for p in c.all_positions() if p.h.startswith('@thin')]
    print(aList)</t>

**g**
    The predefined constant g is the leo.core.leoGlobals module. This
    module contains several dozen utilty functions and classes.

**g.app**
    g.app is the **application object** representing the entire Leo application.
    The instance variables (ivars) of g.app represent Leo's global variables.

**commander**
    The predefined constant c is the commander of the window containing the
    script. Commanders represent all aspects of a single Leo window. For any
    commander c, c.p is the presently selected position (see below), and
    c.rootPosition() is the root (first) position in the outline. Given
    c, Leo scripts can gain access to all data present while Leo is running,
    including all of Leo's classes, functions and data.

**position**
    The predefined constant p is the position of the presently selected
    node. Positions represent locations in Leo outlines. For any position p,
    p.v is the vnode at that position.

**vnode**
    A vnode represents a single outline node. Because of clones, a vnode may
    appear in several places on the screen. Vnodes hold most of the data in Leo
    outlines. For any vnode v, v.h is the node's headline, and v.b
    is the node's body text. As a convenience, for any position p, p.h
    and p.b are synonyms for p.v.h and p.v.b.

<t tx="ekr.20040414172218.2">Leo_ has thousands of users_. Like me, many of them would never willingly be without Leo again.
Here are Leo's essential features:

1.  Leo outlines_ show you the big picture at all times,
    while providing unlimited space for details.

2.  Leo outlines_ can organize any kind of data:
    computer programs, web sites, documentation, pictures, whatever.

3.  Clones_ allow multiple views of the data within a *single* outline_.
    You don't have to choose the 'correct' view; you can see data in many ways.

4.  Plugins_ allow Leo's users to add new features to Leo.
    Many of Leo's most successful features started life this way.

5.  Leo is a superb scripting_ environment for Python.
    Scripts contained in a Leo outline_ have easy access to all the outline's data.
    It is natural to organize Leo outlines to make life easier for scripts.

6.  Leo is `Open Software`_, written in 100% pure Python_.
    Leo runs wherever Python does.

Leo has a strong and active community of users on `SourceForge`_.
Working with this community has been a constant source of joy and inspiration.
Suggestions and plugins from users continue to drive Leo in excellent new directions.

<t tx="ekr.20040705111716.1">Leo will write only t.unknownAttributes to the .leo file when writing the &lt;v&gt;
element corresponding to the root of an @thin tree. Leo will do this by writing
a new xml attribute, say descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes, in &lt;v&gt; element.

The reason that Leo will only write t.unknownAttributes and not
v.unknownAttributes is that only tnodes have gnx's in thin external files. In
effect, vnodes are anonymous. We could attempt to get around this by identifying
vnodes by their corresponding tnodes, but that's not a general solution and it
is, in effect, equivalent to writing only t.unknownAttributes. This being so, it
seems pointless to "pretend" to be writing v.unknownAttributes.

The effect of this is to make all vnodes identical, as far as using
unknownAttributes is concerned. As I've stated in the past, this won't do if,
for example, a plugin is trying create an arbitrary directed graph between
vnodes. In that case, the plugin should confine itself to @file trees, or just
vnodes in .leo files, for that matter.

7/1/04:

- Leo now writes "marks" and "expanded" attributes in the root &lt;v&gt; element for @thin trees.

- VERY IMPORTANT.  Leo now writes entire tree of @ignored @thin nodes.  This fixes a major bug.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040705111716.126"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20040705111716.45">Leo marks as dirty all @file nodes when they become "newly unignored".</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040705112148"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20040705150130">Leo now generates no warnings with all significant tests enabled.  Some tests have been disabled in bases classes, and in a few cases pychecker gives erroneous warnings that have been suppressed directly in the source code using the __pychecker__ = arg syntax.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040713110718">Leo 4.2 beta 3           August 10, 2004

This version of Leo is feature complete.  Leo's core code has been stable for several months.

To do: most plugins work with the new code base, but other plugins need some more work.

The highlights of Leo 4.2:

- @thin trees make Leo much more friendly to cvs. Files derived from @thin can
be committed to cvs and updated from cvs without having to commit or update the
corresponding .leo file. There is no longer any need to keep .leo files and
external files in synch.

- Leo's data structures have been reorganized. As a result, all outline
operations are much faster. To support this organization, scripts that traverse
Leo's data structures must now use a positions rather than vnodes. Old scripts
that appear to use vnodes will still work because methods like c.currentVnode
that appear to return vnodes actually return positions.

- A new mod_scripting plugin is a big advance in scripting and testing.
test.leo now uses @test and @script nodes to define unit tests without
explicitly creating subclasses of unittest.TestCase. Converting scripts to unit
tests now takes a few seconds!

- A much faster and more robust spell checker plugin. (requires Python 2.3)

- Leo is now much more friendly to using spaces instead of tabs.

- The Execute Script command reports erroneous lines more clearly.

- The Perfect Import feature guarantee that Leo imports file exactly.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040804164600.102">Spurious entries in a tnodeList for @thin trees wiped out all the headlines in the @thin tree.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040804164600.16">Leo now vetoes the shutdown logic if saving a dirty file fails.

Leo prints in red the warning about not being able save the read-only file. The
user can use the Save To command to save the file. The Save To command does not
clear the file's dirty bit, so Leo will prompt again to save the file. The user
will have to ignore this prompt in order to exit. This is correct: the
_original_ file has not been saved.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040804164600.265"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20040804164600.275"># The new code only writes tnodes for the current tree when pasting to the clipboard.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040804164600.36">- g.getScript implicitly assumed that p == c.currentPosition.
  I removed that assumption.

- The scriptButton callback in the scripting.py plugin no longer calls c.executeScript.
  It's simpler and easier to call exec directly.

- Improved c.checkOutline:
    - Added full keyword arg.
    - Print more if verbose is on.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040804164600.377">There was a big performance bug in the nodenavigator plugin.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040804164600.394">@nocolor

As a result, the minimal .leo file is:

@color
@language html

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;leo_file&gt;
&lt;leo_header/&gt;
&lt;globals/&gt;
&lt;preferences/&gt;
&lt;find_panel_settings/&gt;
&lt;vnodes/&gt;
&lt;tnodes/&gt;
&lt;/leo_file&gt;

@nocolor

The empty_leo_file plugin now uses this code. The minimal .leo file that Leo
might actually write is more like this:

@color

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;leo_file&gt;
&lt;leo_header/&gt;
&lt;globals/&gt;
&lt;preferences/&gt;
&lt;find_panel_settings&gt;
    &lt;find_string/&gt;

<t tx="ekr.20040804165258.4">Added the Check submenu of the Outline menu. This contains the Check Outline and
Dump Outline commands, as well as four new commands:

The Check All Python Code and Check Python Code commands report any syntax
errors or tabnanny errors. These commands mark erroneous nodes. These commands
work on the selected Node and its descendants. These commands ignore any nodes
for which a) @ignore is in effect or b) @language python is in not effect.

The Check Python Code and Pretty Print Python Code commands replace nodes with
their pretty-printed alternative. No doubt everyone will have their own favorite
style. You could implement alternate pretty printers in a plugin merely by
overriding the following methods of class prettyPrinter in leoCommands.py:
    
---- putOperator:      puts whitespace around operators.
---- putNormalToken:   puts whitespace around everything else.</t>

The shortcut definitions in Leo are quite inconvenient on the Mac, as those
using the Alt key don't work. Alt is used for entry of additional characters.
On the other hand, ctrl is available for shortcuts but not used in Leo, since
the ctrl-based shortcuts are shifted to the command key (following standard
Mac practice).

The patch at the end of this message simply shifts all Alt-shortcuts to Ctrl
on the Mac.

That leaves one minor clash: Command-` is used for CloneNode in Leo, although
it canonical MacOS function (switching between the windows of an application)
would be very useful in Leo as well. Removing the CloneNode binding is easy
enough, but it seems that I must implement a window switching function myself.
Not today :-)

The highlights of Leo 4.2:

- @thin trees make Leo much more friendly to cvs. Files derived from @thin can
be committed to cvs and updated from cvs without having to commit or update the
corresponding .leo file. There is no longer any need to keep .leo files and
external files in synch.

- Leo's data structures have been reorganized. As a result, all outline
operations are much faster. To support this organization, scripts that traverse
Leo's data structures must now use a positions rather than vnodes. Old scripts
that appear to use vnodes will still work because methods like c.currentVnode
that appear to return vnodes actually return positions.

<t tx="ekr.20050122084954">Leo stores options in @settings trees, that is, parts of Leo outlines whose root node has the headline @settings.  When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees in the following places:

- The file called leoSettings.leo in the leo/config directory.
- The file called leoSettings.leo in the users home directory.
- The file being loaded.

Settings that later in the above list override settings found earlier. For
example, any setting specified in an @settings tree in the file being loaded
overrides any setting seen in any leoSettings.leo file.

The Settings command temporarily replaces the outline pane with an outline
showing all the @settings trees in effect. The Settings command also replaces
the body pane with a "settings dialog" pane. This settings dialog pane allows
you to change the settings selected in the outline pane using standard gui
widgets.

The format of nodes in @settings trees are as follows:

1. "Simple settings nodes" have headlines of the form:

@&lt;type&gt; name = val

set the value of name to val, with the indicated type.

&lt;type&gt; may be one of the following, with valid values shown:

&lt;type&gt;          Valid values
-----           ------------
\@bool           True, False, 0, 1
\@color          A Tk color name or value, such as 'red' or 'xf2fddff' (without the quotes)

For a list of Tk color specifiers see:

- http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkCmd/colors.htm
- http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkLib/GetColor.htm

\@directory      A path to a directory
\@float          A floating point number of the form nn.ff.
\@int            An integer
\@ints[list]     An integer (must be one of the ints in the list).
                 Example: @ints meaningOfLife[0,42,666]=42
\@path           A path to a directory or file
\@ratio          A floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.
\@string         A string
\@strings[list]  A string (must be one of the strings in the list).
                 Example: @strings tk_relief['flat','groove','raised']='groove'

2. "Complex settings nodes" have headlines of the form:

\@&lt;type&gt; description

The actual settings are specified in the body text.  At present, there are two such kinds of complex settings nodes:

- @font

The body text contains a list of settings for a font.  For example:

body_text_font_family = Courier New
body_text_font_size = None
body_text_font_slant = None
body_text_font_weight = None

- @recentFiles

The body text contains a list of paths of recently opened files, one path per line.

Warning: The following features of @recentfiles nodes are confusing and probably
will be changed:

- Leo does not save recent file information unless the open .leo file has an
@settings tree and an @recentfiles node within the @settings tree. That is, Leo
does not save recent files information in leoSettings.leo files.

- Changing the @rencentfiles node doesn't mark the Leo file as dirty, so if you
don't save the .leo file the recent files information will not be updated.

3.  All other nodes are "Organizer" nodes.  Such nodes have no effect on the settings shown in the dialog.  You may use them as you please to organize settings.

Notes:

A.  At present, you can not change @settings trees while executing the Settings command.  You can, however, change any @settings tree normally when not executing the Settings command.

B. Other kinds of settings nodes are planned for future releases.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050122090311">Leo 4.3 alpha 1                 January 24, 2005

Leo 4.3 is the culmination of more than four months of work. 

The defining features of Leo 4.3:

1. Leo now stores options in @settings trees, that is, outlines whose headline
is '@settings'. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees not only
in the outline being opened but also in various leoSettings.leo files.

The key design goal of @settings trees was that Leo's user options must be
infinitely flexible. That goal has been accomplished. Indeed, users can create
arbitrarily complex user options with @settings trees. Leo settings outlines
are, in fact, infinitely more flexible and powerful than any scheme based on
flat text.  Readers of Python's configParser shootout take note!

2. The Settings command temporarily replaces the outline pane with an outline
showing all the @settings trees in effect. The Settings command also replaces
the body pane with a "settings pane". This settings pane allows you to change
the settings selected in the outline pane using standard gui widgets. The
settings pane is dynamically created from nodes in the settings tree; it is as
extensible as the @settings tree itself.

3. Leo's read/write code in leoAtFile.py has been rewritten to support user-
defined tangling and untangling.  This is a major cleanup of Leo's core.

4. Leo now boasts a wonderful new Plugins Manager plugin. This plugin enables
and disables plugins automatically. This plugin also tells you everything you need to know
about each plugin. Finally, this plugin also lets you download plugins from
Leo's cvs site! Many thanks to Paul Patterson for this excellent work.

5. You can install third-party extensions in Leo's extensions directory. Leo
will attempt to import such extensions from the extensions directory if normal
imports fail.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050122091036">The essential features of @settings trees and the settings dialog appear to be stable.  However, many improvements can be imagined, including the following:

- Allow searching for nodes while in the settings dialog.

- Allow adding, deleting, rearranging nodes while in the settings dialog.

- Allow adding, deleting, rearranging recent files while in the settings dialog.

These will be added as time permits and people request.</t>

BTW, the way to set javascript "inner" comments is to use @delims, not @comment.
N.B. The @language and @comment delimiters _will_ have an effect, and that

<t tx="ekr.20050123092834.565">Leo's code now contains an important simplification to Leo's gui code. This
arose because of a problem in the UNL plugin. The window that opened when double
clicking an @url UNL node wasn't staying on top.

It turns out that this was essentially impossible to fix with the old code. The
proximate cause of the original problem button-1 was bound to OnActivateTree,
which called g.app.gui.set_focus after the new window was visible, thereby
bringing the old tree to the front.

Further investigation revealed other problems. For example, the idle-time code
in the status line logic was also messing with the focus. It turns out that
repeatedly calling g.app.gui.set_focus is a very bad idea, for lots of reasons
which I won't go into in detail here.

The old code called g.app.gui.set_focus explicitly whenever it wanted focus to
change. But there is a much better way, namely to have routines that _indicate_
where they want the focus to be "after the dust settles", that is, when all gui
calls have been completed. I call this a "delayed focus" scheme.

So I rewrote all the code that sets the focus. The new code replaces direct
calls to g.app.gui.set_focus with calls to the following methods in
leoTkinterFrame class: bodyWantsFocus, statusLineWantsFocus, treeWantsFocus and
logWantsFocus. Actually, these xWantsFocus methods all do the same thing, but
using different methods improves traces.

This is an excellent pattern. Again, rather than setting the focus directly,
these xWantsFocus methods merely signal their intension to set the focus. This
allows very complex logic to be hidden in leoTkinterFrame.set_focus.

leoTkinterFrame.set_focus is indeed complex. It took me several hours this
morning to get it just right. It queues up a 'one-shot' callback. That is, at
most one copy of the callback is ever waiting to be executed. Furthermore, the
callback is only queued for execution at the result of a call to xWantsFocus; it
is never run automatically at idle time. Finally, even when executed, the
callback does nothing if the last requested commander (in the new ivar,
g.app.wantedFocus) does not match the commander to which the callback was bound.

These checks allow the UNL plugin to open a window properly and keep it topmost.

This is a big step forward for Leo, for the following reasons:

- Delayed focus ensures that the body pane always has focus unless the code has
a specific, positive reason for the focus to be elsewhere. This was difficult
(or rather impossible) to do with the old code: there are _many_ Tk calls that
can affect the focus.

- Delayed focus minimizes calls to g.app.gui.set_focus. Unlike the old code,
many seconds may elapse between calls. The stress on Tk is much less, and I
believe this may cure some flakiness in how focus changes, especially in
headlines.

- There are some cases where focus must change immediately. The xWantsFocus
methods all support a 'later' keyword argument. By default it is True, but when
it is False leoTkinterFrame.set_focus calls g.app.gui.set_focus immediately.

- The xWantsFocus methods all support a 'tag' keyword argument that tells what
routine the method is called from. It is a big help in making sense of traces.
BTW, extensive traces are the _only_ possible way of tracking down
focus/selection problems.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050123092834.71">What I did:
    
- Created a new top-level method: scanHeaderForThin.

This sets self.encoding temporarily. The actual value of self.encoding does not
really matter: no errors will be given by readLine and its helpers even if there
are unicode encoding errors.

- We must _not_ set self.encoding in scanHeader: that would interfere with
normal initialization.</t>

The Equal Sized Panes works again.

- Added many do-nothing methods to nullMenu class.

This should prevent the startup logic from messing with shortcuts in any way.
It's also the right thing to do.

- Added an entry for EqualSizedPanes to leoSettings.leo. This overrides the
default (Ctrl-E) and thereby prevents the default from overriding the entry for
ExecuteScript!

- Re-enabled code in createMenuEntries that warns when shortcuts have been
redefined. Not sure if this is a wise idea, or indeed if it actually does
anything :-)

I am tempted to remove all the default entries entirely. This would simplify
error reporting, but then Leo would hardly work at all if leoSettings.leo were
not present.</t>

Leo 4.3 is the culmination of more than four months of work. This alpha 2
release corrects various bugs and distribution problems.

a2 also adds several new features:

- Adds 'word', 'line' and 'node' undo granularities.
- Predefines 'c','g', and 'p' in scripts and unit tests.

I was pleasantly surprised to discover the reST2 plug-in working under 4.3a2
(this is one the first thing I try as I'd like to use Leo as an editor
for that).

As mentioned in early threads, it still needs @rst for each node to be included
in the reST rendering process. So I put @rst test.html and then a child with
@rst and some reST code and it worked !!

Then I tried to to get a simple rst file using @rst test but the plugin complained:

[snip]

  File "C:\dn_apps\Leo\plugins\rst2.py", line 164, in onIconDoubleClick
    writeTreeAsRst(rstFile,fname,p,c)
TypeError: writeTreeAsRst() takes exactly 5 arguments (4 given)

So I looked at the rst2.py and found a way to get it working but I would need
someone to verify it :

line 164, replaced   writeTreeAsRst(rstFile,fname,p,c)  by

syntax = False
writeTreeAsRst(rstFile,fname,p,c,syntax)

And it worked!

<t tx="ekr.20050306090601">Leo's .leo file format is extensible.
The basis for extending .leo files are the v.unknownAttributes ivars of vnodes,
uA's for short.
Leo translates between uA's and xml attributes in the corresponding
&lt;v&gt; elements in .leo files.
Plugins may also use v.tempAttributes ivars to hold temporary information
that will *not* be written to the .leo file.
These two ivars are called **attribute ivars**.

Attribute ivars must be Python dictionaries, whose keys are names of plugins and
whose values are *other* dictionaries, called **inner dictionaries**, for
exclusive use of each plugin.

The v.u Python property allows plugins to get and set v.unknownAttributes easily::

    d = v.u # gets uA (the outer dict) for v
    v.u = d # sets uA (the outer dict) for v
    
For example:

    plugin_name = 'xyzzy'
    d = v.u # Get the outer dict.
    inner_d = d.get(plugin_name,{}) # Get the inner dict.
    inner_d ['duration']= 5
    inner_d ['notes'] "This is a note."
    d [plugin_name] = inner_d
    v.u = d
    
No corresponding Python properties exist for v.tempAttributes,
so the corresponding example would be::

    plugin_name = 'xyzzy'
    # Get the outer dict.
    if hasattr(p.v,'tempAttributes'): d = p.v.tempAttributes
    else: d = {}
    inner_d = d.get(plugin_name,{}) # Get the inner dict.
    inner_d ['duration'] = 5
    inner_d ['notes'] = "This is a note."
    d [plugin_name] = inner_d
    p.v.tempAttributes = d

**Important**: All members of inner dictionaries should be picklable: Leo
uses Python's Pickle module to encode all values in these dictionaries. Leo will
discard any attributes that can not be pickled. This should not be a major
problem to plugins. For example, instead of putting a tnode into these
dictionaries, a plugin could put the tnode's gnx (a string) in the dictionary.

**Note**: Leo does *not* pickle members of inner dictionaries whose name (key) starts with str\_.
The values of such members should be a Python string.
This convention allows strings to appear in .leo files in a more readable format.

Here is how Leo associates uA's with &lt;v&gt; elements in .leo files:

- **Native xml attributes** are the attributes of &lt;v&gt; elements that are
  known (treated specially) by Leo's read/write code. The native attributes of
  &lt;v&gt; elements are a, t, vtag, tnodeList, marks,
  expanded and descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes. All other attributes of
  &lt;v&gt; and &lt;t&gt; elements are **foreign xml attributes**.

- When reading a .leo file, Leo will create v.unknownAttributes ivars for
  any vnode whose corresponding &lt;v&gt; or &lt;t&gt; element contains a
  foreign xml attribute.

- When writing a file, Leo will write foreign xml attributes in &lt;v&gt; elements
  if the corresponding vnode contains an unknownAttributes ivar.

- Leo performs the usual xml escapes on these strings when reading or writing
  the unknownAttributes ivars.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050313101229">Leo 4.3 alpha 4                 March 15, 2005

Leo 4.3 is the culmination of more than five months of work. This alpha 4
focuses on plugins: all known plugins are now in leoPlugins.leo. Most plugins
now work with the 4.3 code base. Warning: not all plugins have been tested
thoroughly.

This alpha 4 release also adds the frequently-requested Add Comments and Delete
Comments commands to Leo's Edit Body menu.

The defining features of Leo 4.3:

1. Leo now stores options in @settings trees, that is, outlines whose headline
is '@settings'. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees not only
in the outline being opened but also in various leoSettings.leo files.

The key design goal of @settings trees was that Leo's user options must be
infinitely flexible. That goal has been accomplished. Indeed, users can create
arbitrarily complex user options with @settings trees. Leo settings outlines
are, in fact, infinitely more flexible and powerful than any scheme based on
flat text.  Readers of Python's configParser shootout take note!

2. The Settings command temporarily replaces the outline pane with an outline
showing all the @settings trees in effect. The Settings command also replaces
the body pane with a "settings pane". This settings pane allows you to change
the settings selected in the outline pane using standard gui widgets. The
settings pane is dynamically created from nodes in the settings tree; it is as
extensible as the @settings tree itself.

3. Leo's read/write code in leoAtFile.py has been rewritten to support user-
defined tangling and untangling.  This is a major cleanup of Leo's core.

4. Leo now boasts a wonderful new Plugins Manager plugin. This plugin enables
and disables plugins automatically. 
This plugin also tells you everything you need to know
about each plugin. Finally, this plugin also lets you download plugins from
Leo's cvs site! Many thanks to Paul Patterson for this excellent work.

5. You can install third-party extensions in Leo's extensions directory. Leo
will attempt to import such extensions from the extensions directory if normal
imports fail. Leo is distributed with Pmw (Python Mega Widgets), path.py and
sets.py in this directory.</t>

All hooks that use the 'new_c' key now use also include the 'c' key. The 'new_c'
key is deprecated; plugins should use the 'c' key instead.

describe the operation that is being performed. **Note**: u is shorthand for
c.undoer. Most u.beforeX methods return undoData that the client
code merely passes to the corresponding u.afterX method. This data contains
the 'before' snapshot. The u.afterX methods then create a bead containing
both the 'before' and 'after' snapshots.

u.beforeChangeGroup and u.afterChangeGroup allow multiple calls to
u.beforeX and u.afterX methods to be treated as a single undoable entry.
See the code for the Change All, Sort, Promote and Demote
commands for examples. The u.beforeChangeGroup and u.afterChangeGroup
methods substantially reduce the number of u.beforeX and afterX methods
needed.

Plugins and scripts may define their own u.beforeX and afterX methods. Indeed,
u.afterX merely needs to set the bunch.undoHelper and
bunch.redoHelper ivars to the methods used to undo and redo the operation.
See the code for the various u.beforeX and afterX methods for guidance.

p.setDirty and p.setAllAncestorAtFileNodesDirty now return a
dirtyVnodeList that all vnodes that became dirty as the result of an
operation. More than one list may be generated: client code is responsible for
merging lists using the pattern dirtyVnodeList.extend(dirtyVnodeList2)

See the section &lt;&lt; How Leo implements unlimited undo &gt;&gt; in leoUndo.py
for more details. In general, the best way to see how to implement undo is to
see how Leo's core calls the u.beforeX and afterX methods.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.131">- Moved computeGlobalConfigDir, computeHomeDir, computeLoadDir and
startupEncoding from leo.py to leoGlobals.py.

- Created g.computeStandardDirectories and used it in leo.py.

- Created g.createStandAloneApp using the above functions. This function was
based on the 'Standalone Operation' classed in the plugin_manager plugin.
g.createStandAloneApp doesn't actually use any of these classes because the
nullGui class is basically a clumsier version of the BlackHole class.

- Added a do-nothing attachLeoIcon method to nullGui class to suppress a
warning. As I said, the nullGui class is not as elegant as Paul's BlackHole
class.

- Added &lt;&lt;importLeoGlobals&gt;&gt; button to newButtons plugin. This creates a node
  named &lt;&lt; define importLeoGlobals &gt;&gt; whose body text defines an
  importLeoGlobals function.

The idea is that importing leoGlobals from a stand-alone plugin is a bit tricky.
The importLeoGlobals handles these details. Note that we don't want to define
importLeoGlobals in a node included by @others, because this function must be
available to the code in the &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt; section. So we use a named section
and reference it in before referencing the &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt; section. See the
plugin_manager plugin for an example.

- Changed the plugin_manager plugin as follows: - Used the newButtons plugin to
    add an &lt;&lt; define importLeoGlobals &gt;&gt; section. - Simplified the import logic
    using importLeoGlobals function. - Commented out the Standalone Operation
    classes. - Called g.createStandAloneApp in the '__name__ == "__main__"'

- self.outputFile is now a cStringIo object.  However, the heart of the put routine is:

    self.outputFile.write(s)

There were three similar bugs, all arising from the fact that g.os_path_abs and
g.os_path_join return the _working_ directory if the initial path is None!

I removed my HOME directory for testing. This was essential.

- Compute home directory must return None, rather than the working directory if
the HOME variable is None.

- app.setLeoId must be careful (in two sections) to do nothing if any of
(homeDir,globalConfigDir,loadDir) is None.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.3">The initial bug report:

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3048149

The problem arose from a misguided attempt to eliminate non-useful information
from traces. Alas, the baby got thrown out with the bath water.

Here are the changes I made:

 - c.executeScript now calls g.es_exception(full=True) to ensure that a full
 stack trace always gets produced. This is especially important when the
 exception happens in a module (file) called by the script.

- c.executeScript now always executes the section &lt; &lt; dump the lines near the
error &gt; &gt;, regardless of context. The lines are printed (in black) in the log.
This is useful information in almost all cases.

- After much experimentation, g.es_exception is basically unchanged. Note: If
the error occurs in your script itself (as contrasted with an exception thrown
from a file called by your script) Leo always has properly put the cursor on the
offending line. I made no changes in this logic.

BTW, calling pdb.set_trace() in your scripts may cause more problems than it is
worth. Indeed.pdb.set_trace() uses only the information on the stack, and that
may not be enough information to be useful. I usually use g.trace to find out
what is happening. This works well.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.31">The problem is that newButtons must use @nosent, so any changes to newButtons
must be accompanied by a change to LeoPluginsRef.py. There is nothing more that
needs to be done.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.316">The only changes concern how Leo encodes and decodes items in
t.unknownAttributes and v.unknownAttributes.

Without changing the file format, the only way to tell Leo how to write
attributes is to use naming conventions. When writing attributes, Leo now does
the following:

- Do nothing except apply xml escapes if the attribute name (in
t.unknownAttributes or v.unknownAttributes) starts with str_ and the attribute
is, in fact, a string. If the string is a Unicode string Leo converts the
Unicode string to an encoded string.

- Use the present pickling/hexlifying scheming otherwise. In particular, issue a
warning and ignore the attribute if the attribute can not be pickled. BTW, there
is no need for separate base64 support: hexlifying guarantees that the result is
valid in any xml environment.

Leo now does the reverse when reading.

BTW, plugins could add their own naming conventions in an emergency. Indeed, the
conventions will be confined to code in atFile.putUa and atFile.getUa, so a
plugin would only need to override these two methods.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.347">Removed inAtOthers  param from putOpen/CloseNodeSentinel.

Note: most(all?) top-level atFile.write methods pass toString to initWriteIvars.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.353">Leo stores recent files information as follows.

1. Leo stores recent files info in files called .leoRecentFiles.txt. These will
be a plain text files with one line per recent files entry. An Easter egg: if
the file starts with read-only, read_only, readonly, etc. Leo will never update
the file and will not remember changes to the Recent Files menu.

2. On startup, Leo searches for the .leoRecentFiles.txt files in the user's home
directory, if it exists. Leo looks in Leo's config directory next, but only if
the home directory does not exist, or does not contain a .leoRecentFiles.txt
file. In other words, Leo will use at most one .leoRecentFiles.txt file on
startup.

3. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for .leoRecentFiles.txt in the directory
containing the file.

4. At no time after installation does Leo create any .leoRecentFiles.txt file.
This will allow users (or their managers) to set policy regarding where to store
this information (if anywhere).

5. Leo writes at most one .leoRecentFiles.txt file when saving a .leo file,
namely the file read in item 3 if it exists, or the file read in item 2
otherwise.

This is a flexible scheme that should meet most needs without having to resolve
thorny questions about exactly where recent files info belongs.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.354">@killcolor

- Properly implemented undo/redo Clear Recent Files.

- readSettingsFiles now reads @recentfiles nodes from all settings files.

- Created @settings nodes and @recent-files nodes if they do not exist.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.355">You all have convinced me that storing recent files data in .leo files is a
dubious idea. My new plan is as follows:

1. Leo will store recent files info in files called .leoRecentFiles.txt. These
will be a plain text files with one line per recent files entry. These will be
local files, so problems concerning directory structure and path specifications
should go away.

2. On startup, Leo will search for the .leoRecentFiles.txt files in the user's
home directory, if it exists. Leo will look in Leo's config directory next, but
only if the home directory does not exist, or does not contain a
.leoRecentFiles.txt file. In other words, Leo will use at most one
.leoRecentFiles.txt file on startup.

3. When opening a .leo file, Leo will look for .leoRecentFiles.txt in the
directory containing the file.

4. At no time after installation will Leo create any .leoRecentFiles.txt file.
This will allow users (or their managers) to set policy regarding where to store
this information (if anywhere).

5. Leo will write at most one .leoRecentFiles.txt file when saving a .leo file,
namely the file read in item 3 if it exists, or the file read in item 2
otherwise.

6. Leo will have settings to tell which .leoRecentFiles.txt files may be
written.

7. Leo will never create @settings nodes or @recent-files nodes automatically.
Moreover, I shall remove the @recent-files panel from the settings dialog and
the corresponding @recent-files code from the config classes.

I believe this will address everyone's concerns without the need for resolving
thorny questions about exactly where recent files info belongs.</t>

The nav_buttons plugin was using self.c rather than keywords.get('c') in a hook
handler. The general rule is that hook handlers should do nothing if self.c !-
keywords.get('c').  This was an old bug, arising from the rewrite of the plugin.

I added a warning to that effect in the plugin template.

It would perhaps be better to specify an optional commander in registerHandler
and only call the handler if the commander matches. However, this isn't so easy
or clean to do.I

The plugin was failing to set the positionList ivar (in the base
tkinterListBoxDialog class). This was a fairly recent blunder: I saw that
positionList wasn't used in the plugin directly, so I 'improved' the code by
using a local var instead of self.positionList. This illustrates a hazard of
using subclassing.</t>

Leo 4.3 is here after almost five months of work.

The defining features of Leo 4.3:
---------------------------------
1. Leo now stores options in @settings trees, that is, outlines whose headline
is '@settings'. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees not only
in the outline being opened but also in various leoSettings.leo files.

The key design goal of @settings trees was that Leo's user options must be
infinitely flexible. That goal has been accomplished. Indeed, users can create
arbitrarily complex user options with @settings trees. Leo settings outlines
are, in fact, infinitely more flexible and powerful than any scheme based on
flat text.  Readers of Python's configParser shootout take note!

2. The Settings command temporarily replaces the outline pane with an outline
showing all the @settings trees in effect. The Settings command also replaces
the body pane with a "settings pane". This settings pane allows you to change
the settings selected in the outline pane using standard gui widgets. The
settings pane is dynamically created from nodes in the settings tree; it is as
extensible as the @settings tree itself.

3. Leo now stores recent files information in .leoRecentFiles.txt files.

4. Leo's read/write code in leoAtFile.py has been rewritten to support user-
defined tangling and untangling.  This is a major cleanup of Leo's core.

5. Leo now boasts a wonderful new Plugins Manager plugin. This plugin enables
and disables plugins automatically. This plugin also tells you everything you need to know
about each plugin. Finally, this plugin also lets you download plugins from
Leo's cvs site! Many thanks to Paul Patterson for this excellent work.

6. You can install third-party extensions in Leo's extensions directory. Leo
will attempt to import such extensions from the extensions directory if normal
imports fail. Leo is distributed with Pmw (Python Mega Widgets), path.py and
sets.py in this directory.</t>

By: rogererens

I swear I didn't wait for the release to be the first to report a bug! I just
didn't try this in the alpha/beta versions:

Leo 4.3 final, build  1.262 , May 23, 2005
Python 2.4.1, Tk 8.4.7, win32

Changing
Global settings: C:\Leo\config\leoSettings.leo--&gt;Window options--&gt;@page Options
for new windows--&gt;@ratio initial_horizontal_ratio = 0.3
or any of the other ratios, does not save them to leoSettings.leo. So after
restarting I still have the old settings in use.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050620144052.48">- Fixed bugs in convertAllBlanks and convertAllTabs.

These must always call afterChangeGroup to match beforeChangeGroup, even if
nothing has changed.

- Added u.getMark and u.rollbackToMark.

These allow unit tests to cut the undo stack back to an initial position in the
tearDown method. This should be done for all tests that use u.undo and u.redo
methods. The bug was probably the result of changing the outline in the tearDown
method.

Both the Reformat Paragraph and Edit Body unit tests now roll back the undo stack.

- Added traces for unexpected conditions in u.undo, u.redo and tree.select.

- Call u.setUndoTypes() in u.setUndoTypingParams when returning early.

- Corrected Edit Body unit tests.

These tests should not call undo/redo when nothing is expected to change. Doing
so may trigger the new 'cant undo' traces in u.undo.

- doTest in leoTest.py now makes copies of both p and p1.

It's not clear that this is needed, it can't hurt, and it may have been important.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050620144052.6">http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3167166

The fix was to add the following line to the init function:

    global click_registry, coloured_nodes</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050620144052.8">Modifying outlines can invalidate existing positions! This rarely happens. At
present it affects the atFile.read logic when reading an outline whose initial
current position is a clone outside an @thin tree with another clone inside the
@thin tree. So the read logic computes the expected current position before
reading all external files, and this expected current position becomes invalid.

What I did:

1. Moved &lt;&lt; set current and top positions &gt;&gt; from getVnodes to end of
getLeoFile. This ensures that the outline won't change after computing the
position.

2. Unit tests will have to be revised to make sure that only valid positions get
used.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.10">The rst3 command defines a code-block rST directive. The primary purpose of this
directive is to show formatted source code.

In rst mode you can insert the code-block directive like any other rST markup.
The rst3 command generates code-block directives when handling nodes in code
mode.

This directive takes one argument, a language name.  Like this::

    .. code-block:: Python

        import leo.core.leoPlugins as leoPlugins
        import leo.core.leoGlobals as g

This directive syntax colors the code in the indented code block that follows the directive.
The result looks like this if the SilverCity syntax coloring module has been installed.

.. .. code-block:: Python

    .. import leo.core.leoPlugins as leoPlugins
    .. import leo.core.leoGlobals as g

.. Otherwise, the output looks like this::

    .. import leo.core.leoPlugins as leoPlugins
    .. import leo.core.leoGlobals as g

See the Scripting chapter in LeoDocs.leo for many examples of how to use
code-blocks.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.11">HTML files generated by the rst3 command assume that three .css (cascading style
sheet) files exist in the same directory. For the HTML output to look good the
following .css files should exist:

- default.css is the default style sheet that docutils expects to exist.

- leo_rst.css contains some style improvements based on Gunnar Schwant's DocFactory.

- silver_city.css is the style sheet that controls the syntax highlighting generated by SilverCity.

The latter two style sheets are imported at the end of the default.css.

**Important:** You can use cascading style sheets to do things that otherwise
wouldn't be possible with "plain" rST. For instance, the background color of
this page was specified in a body style.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.12">Leo reserves the '#' character for your own use so that you can
specify an rST headline explicitly. For example,::

    #####
    Title
    #####

You would typically put such a title in the rst root node. Otherwise, you should
let the rst3 command automatically generate rST sections from headlines.

To create a table of contents (TOC) put::

    .. contents:: Table of Contents

on its own line wherever you want the TOC to appear.  This line can appear in body text in rst mode,
or in an @ @rst-markup doc part in code mode.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.13">The file ListManagerDocs.html_ is an impressive example of the kind of output
that can be generated relatively easily using the rst3 command.

The source for ListManagerDocs.html is wxListManager.leo_. **Important**:
wxListManager.leo was written for the old rst2 plugin; it could be greatly
simplified if adapted for the rst3 command.

The files in LeoDocs.leo under the node 'Leo's HTML Users Guide' contain
examples of using the rst3 command.

This documentation was created using the rst3 command. The source code for this
documentation is in LeoDocs.leo. The source code for all the rst3 command is in
leoRst.py in leoPy.leo.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.14">The code for the rst3 command is more complex than usual. Fortunately, the
overall organization is straightforward.

defaultOptionsDict
    This dictionary represents each rst3 option.
    To add another option, just add another entry to this dictionary.
    Keys are the option name, including the `rst3_` prefix.
    Values are the default value of the option.
    The hard values in the dictionary may be changed as the result of @settings entries.

processTree
    processTree is the top-level code that handles one rst root node.
    It calls preprocessTree to create the **tnodeOptionDict** ivar.
    processTree then calls either writeNormalTree or writeSpecialTree
    depending on whether text will be sent to docutils for further processing.
    These two methods handle mundane details of opening an closing files.
    Both writeNormalTree and writeSpecialTree call **writeTree** to do the actual work.

tnodeOptionDict
    The entries in this dictionary represents the options that are set in one particular node.
    The keys of tnodeOptionDict are tnodes, the values are anonymous dictionaries.
    These anonymous inner dictionaries contain the options that are explicitly set at each tnode
    (and thus each position).
    Preprocessing the tree this way ensures that each node (headline and body text) is parsed exactly once.

writeTree
    writeTree first calls **scanAllOptions**, which has the effect of
    initializing all options. writeTree then calls **writeNode** for each node
    that will be processed by the rst3 command. Options may cause the rst3 command to
    skip a node or an entire subtree.

writeNode
    writeNode first calls **scanAllOptions** to compute the options that are in
    effect for that *single* node. Once options have computed, processing the
    node is straightforward. writeNode calls writeBody and writeHeadline
    to do the real work. These methods generate or skip text based on various
    options.

scanAllOptions
    scanAllOptions recreates the optionsDict ivar to represent *all* the options
    in effect for *for the particular node being processed by writeNode*. Client
    code gets these options by calling the getOption method.

    scanAllOptions first inits all options from settings,
    then updates those options using the anonymous
    dictionaries contained in the tnodeOptionsDict.
    scanAllOptions works like g.scanAllDirectives, but the code is much simpler.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.16">Josef Dalcolmo wrote the initial rst plugin.
Timo Honkasalo, Bernhard Mulder, Paul Paterson, Kent Tenney and
Steve Zatz made contributions to the rst and rst2 plugins.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.2">reStructuredText_ (rST) is a popular markup language for writing documents. rST
is simple, yet powerful. All of Leo's documentation is written in rST, and then
processed via the docutils_ and Sphinx_ processors to produce Leo's web pages.

Leo makes writing rST documents easier. A *lot* easier. There are several
reasons for this:

1. Leo outlines help organize rST source code in all the usual ways. You always
clearly see the structure of even book-length documents. You can rearrange and
reorganize chapters, sections and paragraphs effortlessly. You can use clones to
create multiple views of your writing for yourself and your readers. These
capabilities, all by themselves, would make Leo an excellent choice for editing
rST documents.

2. Leo fixes the clumsiest part of rST markup, namely the markup for headings.
Without Leo, you must underline heading lines manually. The underlining
character indicates the level of a heading. Changing the level of a heading is
clumsy and error prone: you must change the underlining character properly.
Changing the level of several headings is a headache.

Leo gets rid of all this bother. Within an outline that gets written to an
external rST file, Leo's headlines become section headings. When writing
external rST files, **Leo generates underlining for headers automatically**
based on the outline level of the outline nodes. When you rearrange your outline
Leo will recompute the rST markup needed to recreate the outline structure in
the external rST file. In most cases, you won't even see the rST markup for
headings!

3. @auto-rst nodes allow you to edit exising rST files in Leo. The outline
structure of such nodes mirrors the level of the rST section headings. Note:
there may be minor variations the first time you import an existing rST file,
but these differences will not affect the meaning of the rST file. After the
first import, the only changes when writing the imported rST file will be
changes *you* make.

The three features just discussed (Leo's organizational capabilities, automatic
generation of markup for rST headings, and @auto-rst trees) are useful for
anyone using reStructuredText. In addition Leo provides additional capabilities
for power users:

4. @rst trees can contain settings that affect how Leo writes individual nodes.

@rst trees allows the ultimate in flexible formating.
We'll discuss these options in detail later, but here are a few examples.

- Headlines that starts with @rst-no-head do not create an rST heading.

- Body text that starts with::

    @rst-option code_mode = True

causes the body text of the node to be displayed as an rST code block.

Leo's rst3 command generates .htm, .html or .tex output files from @rst tree,
provided that you have installed Python's docutils_ module.  The rst3 command
will use the SilverCity_ syntax coloring package if it installed.

The rst3 command sends .htm, .html or .tex files to the docutils module for further
processing. Docutils generates HTML files or LaTeX files depending on the file's
extension. HTML files generated by docutils refer to three .css (cascading style
sheet) files that should exist in the same directory as the generated HTML file.
You can control the formatting of the HTML file by altering these .css files.
See `Required cascading style sheets`_ for more details.

5. The rST options just discussed will suffice to create just about any kind of
rST output. But for those desiring the ultimate in flexibility, it is relatively
straightforward to create Leo outlines or external files using scripts. For
example, you might want to write a script to format source code to rST markup. A
script can give you complete control over such formatting. This chapter
concludes by telling how to write such scripts.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.3">1. The rst3 command allows much more flexible control over its operations using
**rst options**. You can set options in @settings trees, in headlines and in
body text. Nodes inherit most rst3 options from ancestor nodes much like nodes
inherit Leo directives. See `Options`_.

The most important option is the code_mode option. This option specifies whether
to process the body text of a node as rst markup (rst mode) or source code that
is to be converted to rST markup (code mode). Any node can be processed in any mode.

2. Headlines can set any option. This turns out to be very convenient. See
`Headline commands`_ for details. Nodes whose headlines start with @rst-options
are treated specially. The body text of such **rst options nodes** should
contain nothing but lines of the form::

    &lt;option&gt;=&lt;value&gt;

3. You can set any rst options in the *body text* of any node using doc parts
of the form::

    @ @rst-options
    list of rst options, one per line
    @c

Such **option doc parts** allows you to specify rst options even with source code files.

4. You can embed rST markup in the body text of any node using doc parts of the
form::

    @ @rst-markup
    any rST markup
    @c

Such **markup doc parts** allow you to fine-tune the formatting of your source files.
See `Using doc parts`_ for full details.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.4">You can set any option in any node, so you have complete control over how the
rst3 command processes each node. The following is a list of options that
control how the rst3 command formats each particular node.

code_mode (default: False)
    True: process nodes in code mode.  False: process nodes in rst mode.
    In code mode, the rst3 command automatically creates rST markup to display the body text as an
    rst code-block. In rst mode the rst3 simply copies the body text of the node to the output. That
    is, the rst3 command assumes that body text is already valid rST markup.

doc_only_mode (default: False)
    True: process nodes in doc_only mode.
    False: process nodes in rst mode or code_mode, depending on options.
    In doc_only mode, the rst3 command outputs only regular doc parts and @ @rst-markup doc parts.
    Headlines create section in doc_only mode only if
    a\) the node contains a doc part or b\) the show_organizer_nodes option is in effect.
    As always can use @ @rst-options for per-node control of the process,
    especially node-by-node control of the show_organizer_nodes option.

default_path (default: '')
    The path to be prepended to filenames given in root nodes.

default_encoding (default: utf-8)
    The default encoding to be used for non-ascii (unicode characters).

encoding (default: the default_encoding setting)
    The encoding to be used for non-ascii (unicode) characters.
    **Important**: this option has effect only in @rst-options doc parts
    in root @rst nodes.

generate_rst (default: True)
    A master switch.
    True: generate rST markup for rST sections and rST code-blocks.
    False: don't generate rST markup and ignore @ @rst-markup doc parts.

generate_rst_header_comment (default: True)

    This option has effect only if the generate_rst and write_intermediate_file
    options are both True. When this option is in effect, Leo writes a comment
    line of the form::

        .. rst3: filename: &lt;filename&gt;

    at the start of intermediate files.

number_code_lines (default: True)
    Controls whether to number code lines in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.

publish-argv-for-missing-stylesheets (Default: '')
    The arguments to be passed to docutils.core.Publisher().publish()
    when no stylesheet is in effect.
    This is a string that represents a comma-separated list of strings:
    For example, the option::

        publish-argv-for-missing-stylesheets=--language=de,--documentclass=report,--use-latex-toc

    results in the call::

        publish(['--language=de','--documentclass=report','--use-latex-toc'])

show_doc_parts_as_paragraphs (default: False)
    True: Move doc parts outside of the code-block directive in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.
    **Cool**: Any rST markup in doc parts included as the result of this option will be rendered properly.

show_doc_parts_in_rst_mode (default: True)
    This option is most useful for rst documents which are not computer code.
    It allows you to use doc parts to make comments on the draft document
    which are either excluded from the output or formatted in a way that highlights
    their nature as comments rather than contet.  For example, you're writing a book, and
    you want to use a doc part at the top of a section to remind yourself "need
    to explain how Ted got to Sally's".    Note: you may need to add
    CSS to have them formatted differently.  The option can be `True`, `False`,
    or one or more class names.

    True: doc parts have no special significance in rst mode.
    That is, the entire doc part from the opening '@' to the closing '@c
    and everything in between are treated as normal rST markup.

    False: doc parts are removed from the output in rst mode

    class name(s):

      The contents of the doc part is processed as it if was in an rst `container`
      directive.  For example::

         @ @rst-options
         show_doc_parts_in_rst_mode = notes literal
         @c

      would wrap the doc part contents in the output in a div with classes
      "container notes literal".  Furthermore, if one of the class names is
      `literal`, then the doc part content will be output as a literal block
      wrapped in a container as described above.  This allows you to use text
      which is not valid rst as rough notes for annotating a draft document.

show_headlines (default: True)
    True: automatically generate rST sections from headlines.
    Applies to both code mode and rst mode.
    The level of the node in the outline determines the level of the section
    underling in the rST markup. Higher-level headlines in the outline
    correspond to higher-level section headings; lower-level headlines in the
    outline correspond to lower-level section headings.

show_leo_directives (default: True)
    True: include Leo directives in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.

show_markup_doc_parts (default: False)
    True: include markup doc parts in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.

show_options_doc_parts (default: False)
    True: include options doc parts in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.

show_options_nodes (default: False)
    True: show @rst-options nodes.

show_organizer_nodes (default: True)
    True: generate rST sections for nodes that do not contain body text.
    This option has no effect unless the rST section would otherwise be written.

show_sections (default: True)
    True: generate rST sections corresponding to headlines.
    False: don't generate sections.  Instead, generate lines of the form::

        **headline**

strip_at_file_prefixes (default: True)
    True: remove @auto, @file, @nosent and @thin from the start of headlines.

stylesheet_name (default: 'default.css')
    The name of the stylesheet passed to docutils.

stylesheet_path (default: '')
    The directory containing the stylesheet passed to docutils.

    :Note:
        If the stylesheet_embed option is True, specify a path relative
        to the location of the Leo file.  If the stylesheet_embed option is
        False, specify a path relative to the location of the HTML file.

stylesheet_embed (default: True)
    | True: The content of the stylesheet file will be embedded in the HTML file.
    | False: The HTML file will link to an external stylesheet file.

underline_characters (default: \'\'\'#=+*^~"'\`-:&gt;&lt;\_\'\'\')
    The underlining characters to be used to specify rST sections.
    The first character is reserved so you can specify the top-level section explicitly.

verbose (default: True)
    True: write informational messages.

write_intermediate_file (default: False)
    True: writes intermediate files before sending them to docutils.
    This option only applies to .htm, .html and .tex files.
    The name of the intermediate file has the name of the output file with .txt appended.
    This option has effect only if the generate_rst option is True.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.5">The following options are for the use of Bernhard Mulder's http plugin. The http
plugin creates an http server running on a local port, typically 8080. When the
http plugin is running you will see a purple message in the log window that
looks something like this::

    http serving enabled on port 8080, version 0.91

To use the http plugin, start a web browser and enter this url::

    http://localhost:8080/

You will see a a top level page containing one link for every open .leo file.  Clicking on link will cause the http server to pass a new page to the browser.  You can use the browser's refresh button to update the top-level view in the browser after you have opened or closed files.

**Important**: See the docstring for the http plugin for information on
configuring the plugin. Some of the following rst3 settings must match values of
settings for the http plugin. Here are the rst3 options that support the http
plugin:

http_server_support (default: False)
    A master switch: none of the following options have any effect unless this option is True.
    If True, the rst3 command does the following:

    - Writes **node markers** in the rst output for use by the http plugin. Node markers are rst named hyperlink targets.  By default they look like::

            .. _http-node-marker-N

      where N is a unique node number.

    - Adds additional information to all nodes of the tree being formatted using Leo's
      unknownAttributes mechanism.

http_attributename (default: 'rst_http_attribute')
    The name of the attribute name written to the unknownAttributes attribute of
    each each outline node in the rst root tree.
    The default is 'rst_http_attribute';
    it should match the following setting of the *http* plugin::

        @string rst_http_attributename = 'rst_http_attribute'

    This option has no effect unless the http_server_support option is True.

clear_http_attributes (default: False)
    If True the rst3 command initially clears the fields specified by `http_attributename`.  
    This option has no effect unless the http_server_support option is True.

node_begin_marker (default: 'http-node-marker-')
    The string used for node markers.
    This option has no effect unless the http_server_support option is True.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.6">The following options specify the 'spelling' of headline commands. The
option_prefix and option_prefixes command also define the spelling of special
doc parts.

You can change these to make them shorter or to avoid conflicts with headlines
in your Leo files. The list below merely gives the default value for each
setting.

`code_prefix`: '\@rst-code'

`ignore_headline_prefix`: '\@rst-no-head'

`ignore_headlines_prefix`: '\@rst-no-headlines'

`ignore_prefix_tree`: '\@rst-ignore'

`ignore_node_prefix`: '\@rst-ignore-node'

`ignore_tree_prefix`: '\@rst-ignore-tree'

`option_prefix`: '\@rst-option'

`options_prefix`: '\@rst-options'

`preformat_prefix`: '\@rst-preformat'

`rst_prefix`: '\@rst'

`show_headline_prefix`: '\@rst-head'</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.7">It is often convenient to set options in headlines.  This is done with the following **headline commands**:

@rst TEXT
    Enter rst mode.  Create a section called TEXT provided the show_headlines option is set.

@rst-code TEXT
    Enter code mode.  Create a section called TEXT provided the show_headlines option is set.

@rst-ignore-node TEXT
    Suppress all output from a single node. TEXT is ignored.
    Has *no* effect on descendant nodes and does **not** change any rst3 option. 

@rst-ignore-tree TEXT and @rst-ignore TEXT
    Suppress all output from the node and its descendants.  TEXT is ignored.
    Does **not** change any rst3 formatting option.

@rst-no-head TEXT
    Suppress the generation of an rST section for this node only.  Does not affect descendant nodes.
    Has *no* effect on descendant nodes and does **not** change any rst3 option. 

@rst-no-headlines TEXT
    Set the show_headlines option to False.  As a result, TEXT is ignored.

@rst-option &lt;option&gt; = &lt;value&gt;
    Set a single option to the given value.  The default value is True.

@rst-options TEXT
    Set zero or more options from the body text of the node.  TEXT is ignored.
    The entire body text is treated as if it were in an @ @rst-options doc part.

@rst-preformat TEXT
    Format the entire body text of the node as if the entire text preformatted.
    TEXT is ignored. In effect, a line containing '::' is added to the start of
    the text, and all following lines of the text are indented. This option has
    no effect on descendant nodes.

**Notes**:

- Several of these commands affect only the node in which they appear.  Such commands set internal settings variables only: they have no effect on the visible rst3 options.

- If a headline generates an rST section, the section name does not include the headline command.  Furthermore, no rST section is generated if the TEXT is empty.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.8">Recall that in Leo a doc part starts with the '@' directive and continues until the end of body text or until the '@c' directive is seen.  For example::

    @ This is a comment in a doc part.
    Doc parts can span multiple lines.
    The next line ends the doc part
    @c

Leo converts doc parts into comments using whatever comment delimiters are in effect.

**Option doc parts** are doc parts that start with @ @rst-options. All other
lines of such doc parts should be of the form name=value. (rST comments lines
starting with '..' are allowed). For example::

    @ @rst-options
    .. This comment line is ignored.
    show_headlines=False
    show_leo_directives=False
    verbose=True
    @c

The rst3 command sets options from option doc parts, even in code mode.

**Markup doc parts** are doc parts that start with @ @rst-markup.  For example::

    @ @rst-markup
    .. contents::

The rst3 command replaces markup doc parts by the markup they contain, even in
code mode.

Option and markup doc parts are especially useful in code mode. They allow you
to specify options or insert rST markup directly from with external files. This
makes your source files self contained: there is no need to add other nodes to
make the rst3 command happy.

A cool feature: In code mode, rST markup in *ordinary* doc parts will be
rendered properly when the show_doc_parts_as_paragraphs option is in effect.
*Important*: Regardless of the show_doc_parts_as_paragraphs option, doc parts
have no special significance in rst mode. That is, the entire `doc part` from
the opening '@' to the closing '@c and everything in between are treated as normal
rST markup.  *Update:* you can now use the `show_doc_parts_in_rst_mode` option
to change this behavior and control the processing of doc parts in rst mode.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.9">You can set the defaults for any rst3 option in several ways:

\1.  By setting options in the root node using @ @rst-options doc parts.
For example, the root of the file that generated this documentation contains::

    @ @rst-options
    code_mode=False
    doc_mode_only=False
    generate_rst=True
    show_organizer_nodes=True
    show_headlines=True
    show_leo_directives=True
    verbose=True
    @c

\2. By setting options in @settings trees.  To do this, you must prefix the option name shown in this documentation with the prefix 'rst3\_'.  For example::

    @settings
        @bool rst3_write_intermediate_file = True

Chapter 4: Writing Programs in Leo
#####################################
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.1">This chapter is a *reference guide* to computer programming with Leo.
This chapter does *not* teach you how to use Leo:
for that you should read `Leo's tutorial`_.
This chapter assumes you are thoroughly familiar with the terminology introduced in the tutorial.
**Note**: Are you *sure* you want to read this chapter?
It contains many details that are no interest to the average user of Leo.
I recommend using Leo for two weeks, or longer, before attempting this chapter.

.. .. contents::</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.30">The following sections give full details about each directive.
The directives listed here may appear in headlines or body text.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.31">The @all directive is valid only in @thin trees.
The @all directive is similar to @others, but it is less restrictive:
it dumps *all* nodes to the external file, including @ignore nodes and nodes that
in an @others tree would be considered to be orphan nodes.

The @all directive is required for files such as @thin leoProjects.txt in LeoPy.leo.
leoProjects.txt contains so-called project nodes.
It doesn't have any meaning as a program file: it is simply a collection of unrelated data.
@others would not work at all: it would complain about lots of orphan nodes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.32">Syntax coloring is on by default in all body text.
Leo formats comments and documentation parts in red,
directives and C keywords in blue,
strings and character constants in gray and all other text in code parts in black.
The @nocolor directive disables syntax coloring for the body text in which it appears.
No syntax coloring is done until an @color directive re-enables syntax coloring.

If a node contains neither the @color nor the @nocolor directive
it may inherit the syntax coloring attribute from an ancestor.
The nearest ancestor that contains exactly one of the @color or @nocolor directives
will control the syntax coloring.
**Ambiguous nodes**, nodes containing both the @color and @nocolor directives,
never affect the coloring of their offspring.

The @nocolor-node directive completely disables coloring for that node only.
Descedant nodes are not affected.

The @killcolor directive completely disables the colorizer for that node.
The result is much faster syntax coloring of large body text.
As usual @killcolor may itself be overridden in descendant nodes.
The differences between @killcolor and @nocolor:

- @nocolor suppresses coloring only until the next @color directive.

- @killcolor overrides @nocolor and @color directives.
  Any node containing @killcolor is unambiguously a @killcolor node regardless of
  whether that node also contains @color or @nocolor directives.

**Note**:
These directives do not affect the Tangle commands in any way.
In particular, the Tangle commands will recognize section definitions as usual even
after an @nocolor directive is seen.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.33">**Note**: the @comment directive is deprecated: you should use the @language
directive whenever possible. However, sometimes using both @language and
@comment is useful. For this to be effective the @comment directive should
appear after the @language directive (in outline order).

The Untangle command will not process an @root or @unit node if an @comment
directive is in effect because Untangle can't be sure of properly parsing an
external file if the language of the external file isn't known. It might be
possible to assume some defaults in this case, but that is not done at present
and is not a high priority. By default, the Tangle commands produces C-language
comments. Single-line comments generated during tangling start with ///, while
documentation parts are surrounded by \* and \*. The @comment directive allows
you to use Tangle to produce shell and make files, as well as source code for
other programming languages.

The @comment directive may be followed by zero to three delimiters, separated by
whitespace. This directive sets the single-line comment delimiter and the
opening and closing block comment delimiters as follows:

====================== =====================================================================
\@comment              no args\: restores the defaults to ///, /\* and \*/
---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\@comment ///          \1 arg\: sets the single-line comment and clears the other delims.
---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\@comment /\* \*/      \2 args\: sets the block comment delims; clears the single-line delim.
---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\@comment /// /\* \*/  \3 args\: sets all three delimiters.
====================== =====================================================================

If only one delimiter is given, Leo does not write any documentation parts while tangling.
If two delimiters are given, block-style comments are used instead of single-line comments.
For example, the @comment { } directive could be used to tangle Pascal files.

The @comment directive is only recognized in @root, @unit, @file and @thin nodes,
and the @comment directive must precede the first section name or @code directive.
An @comment directive in the body text of an @unit directive specifies the current global defaults.
An @comment directive in the body text of an @root directive affects comments generated for one root only.
Comments in all other roots are governed by the global defaults.

Leo will convert underscores in the @comment directives to significant spaces.  For example::

    @comment REM_

causes the comment delimiter to be "REM " (Note the trailing space).</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.34">The @delims directive changes the comment strings used to mark sentinel lines.
This directive is often used to place Javascript text inside XML or HTML files.
The delims directive is not valid in @root or @unit trees.

The @delims directive contains one or two delimiters, separated by whitespace.
If only one delim is present it delimits single-line comments.
If two delims are present they delimit block comments.
The @delims directive can not be used to change the comment strings at the start of the external file,
that is, the comment strings for the @+leo sentinel and the initial @+body and @+node sentinels.

The @delims directive inserts @@delims sentinels into the external file.
The new delimiter strings continue in effect until the next @@delims sentinel in the external file or
the end of the external file.

**Note**: Leo can not revert to previous delimiters automatically;
you must change back to previous delimiters using another @delims directive. For example::

    @delims /* */
    Javascript stuff
    @delims &lt;-- --&gt;
    HTML stuff

Adding, deleting or changing @@delims sentinels will destroy Leo's ability to read the external file.
Mistakes using the @delims directive have no effect on Leo,
though such mistakes will thoroughly mess up a external file as far as compilers,
HTML renderers, etc. are concerned.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.35">You may use the @encoding directive to specify the encoding used in an external file.
You can't mix encodings in a single external file.  For example::

    @encoding iso-8859-1

If the encoding used in an external file is not "utf-8" it is represented in the @+leo sentinel line, like this::

    #@+leo-encoding=iso-8859-1.

The utf-8 encoding is used by default.
The utf-8 encoding is a "lossless" encoding (it can represent all unicode code points),
so encoding and decoding to and from utf-8 plain strings will never cause a problem.
When reading or writing a character not in a "lossy" encoding (such as iso-8859-1),
Leo converts such characters to '?' and issues a warning. </t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.36">The @first directive allows you to place lines at the very start of external files created
by @thin and @file nodes.
For example, the body text of @file spam.py
might be::

	@first #! /usr/bin/env python

The body text of @file foo.perl might be::

	@first #/usr/bin/perl

@first directives are recognized only at the start of the body text of @file and @thin nodes.
No text may precede @first directives.
More than one @first directive may exist, like this::

	@first #! /usr/bin/env python
	@first # more comments.

The @first directive is not valid in @root or @unit trees.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.37">The @language directive specifies the comment delimiters and string types used by the
Tangle and Untangle commands.
This directive over-rides the default specified in the settings dialog.

When the threading_colorizer plugin is enabled, the valid @language directives are::

    @language x

where the leo/modes folder contains the file x.py.  When the threading_colorizier plugin is not enabled,
the 'old' colorizer is used and the valid @language directives are::

    @language actionscript
    @language c
    @language c++
    @language cweb
    @language elisp
    @language html
    @language java
    @language latex
    @language objective-c
    @language pascal
    @language perl
    @language perlpod
    @language plain
    @language python
    @language rebol
    @language shell
    @language tcltk

Shell files have comments that start with `#`.
Case is ignored in the language specifiers, but not in the @language itself.
Thus, the following are equivalent::

    @language html
    @language HTML
    @language hTmL

but the following is invalid::

    @LANGUAGE html</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.38">The @lineending directive sets the line endings for individual external files.
This directive will override the output_newline setting.
The @lineending *never* affects the line endings in .leo files themselves:
.leo files must have consistent line endings!

The valid forms of the @lineending directive are:

======================= ======================================================
\@lineending nl         The default, Linux.
----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
\@lineending cr         Mac
----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
\@lineending crlf       Windows
----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
\@lineending lf         Same as 'nl', not recommended
----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
\@lineending platform   Same as platform value for output_newline setting.
======================= ======================================================</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.39">The @path directives override the deprecated default_tangle_directory setting.

The form of the \@path directive is @path *filename*,
where *filename* is taken to be everything following \@path to the end of the line.

If *filename* is an absolute filename the location of the external file is specified only by the filename.
Otherwise, if *filename* is a relative filename, the location of the external file is relative to:

1. the directory specified the applicable @path directive, or
2. the "Default Tangle Directory" in the Settings dialog if no @path directive is in effect, or
3. the directory in which the .leo file resides if the .leo file has ever been saved.

An error occurs if no absolute path can be computed according to these rules,
or if *filename* does not exist.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.40">The @raw and @end_raw directives are valid only within @file and @thin trees.
The @raw directive starts a section of "raw" text. The @end_raw directive ends
such a section, as does the end of body text. No section references are
recognized within raw text, and no additional leading whitespace is generated
within raw text when writing the external file.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.41">Leo allows you to choose whether body text in @root trees will start in code
mode or doc mode by default. The @root-doc *filename* and @root-code *filename*
directives specify that body text is assumed to start in doc mode or code mode
respectively. The options (-doc and -code) must follow @root immediately with no
intervening whitespace. In effect, @root-code and @root-doc are two new
directives.

These @root options override the at_root_bodies_start_in_doc_mode setting. This
setting affects only @root trees without options. Such "plain" @root trees are
now deprecated, which only means that it is better style to use either the
@root-code or @root-doc directive. The reason is simple: the meaning of plain
@root trees will depend on the at_root_bodies_start_in_doc_mode setting. It's
better to be explicit. By default, at_root_bodies_start_in_doc_mode = 1 for
compatibility for old @root trees. I actually don't think this option is good
for much; I created it before I created @root-doc and @root-code settings, and I
decided it wouldn't hurt to leave it in. Anyway, you now have complete
flexibility about how @root works, and in particular you can make @root work
just like @file.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.42">By default, the body_pane_wraps setting controls whether body text wraps.
You may override this setting for a particular tree using the @wrap and @nowrap directives.
Only the first @wrap or @nowrap directive in a node has any effect.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.43">See `CWEB`_ for a discussion of the CWEB language. CWEB mode refers to how Leo
tangles an outline when @language cweb is in effect or the cweb setting is in
effect. Leo treats *all* cweb code in cweb mode as unevaluated text. That is,
Leo treats cweb control codes, including @&lt;...@&gt;, @&lt;..@&gt;=, @c, @, @* and @** as
"raw" text within cweb mode. Leo does *not* expand *cweb* section references
when writing external files in cweb mode. However, Leo *does* expand *noweb*
section references, so you may use noweb sections to organize cweb files! You
can create *noweb* code and doc sections using the @code and @doc directives in
place of @c and @ directives.

By default, cweb colors @, @* and @** sections using the same syntax coloring as
for LaTeX. In addition, cweb colors C // and /*..*/ comments using LaTeX
coloring by default. You may change these defaults using the
color_cweb_doc_parts_with_latex and color_cweb_comments_with_latex settings.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.45">This section discusses all aspects of @root trees. You should carefully consider
whether the extra flexibility afforded by @root trees is worth the extra bother.
Indeed, @file trees are much easier to use than @root trees:

- @file and @thin trees use less markup than @root trees.
  In particular, the @others directive is valid only within @file and @thin trees.

- You must explicitly tangle and untangle @root trees using the Tangle and Untangle commands.

However, @root trees are more flexible than @file and @thin trees:

- Sections may be defined anywhere within @root trees.
  Moreover, the @unit directive expands the scope of section definitions in @root trees
  so that a section may be referenced in several @root trees.

- The meaning of section definitions in @root trees are independent of their position within the tree.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.47">Just as with @file trees, @root trees may contain code parts and doc parts.
Code parts start with section definition lines (see below) or the @c directive.
Doc parts start with @ directive.
Doc parts continue until the end of body text or until the next @c or @ directive.

Body text in @root trees contain zero or more code and doc parts in any order.
The @c directive starts a named code section if the node's headline starts with &lt;&lt;section name&gt;&gt;.
Otherwise, the @c directive is invalid.

**Section definition lines** are lines of the form::

	&lt;&lt; section name&gt;&gt;=

(note the equal sign).
Such lines also start named code parts.
Named code parts in @root trees may be defined in several places.
The definition of a named code part is the concatenation of all code parts with the same name.
Body text that defines no code part is ignored.
At least one non-blank line must follow the section definition line;
empty sections are not allowed. 

As in @file trees, paired &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; characters on the same line always denote a section name,
even within comments and strings.
Thus, &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; characters that do not delimit a section name must be placed on separate lines.
If &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; are not paired on a line, they are treated as ordinary &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; characters.

Here is a typical example of body text within an @root tree::

    @ This method puts an open node sentinel for node v.
    &lt;&lt;atFile methods&gt;&gt;=
    def putOpenNodeSentinel(self,v):
        if v.isAtFileNode() and v != self.root:
            &lt;&lt; issue an error message &gt;&gt;
        else:
            s = self.nodeSentinelText(v)
            self.putSentinel("@+node:" + s)

Provided that the node's headline starts with &lt;&lt;atFile methods&gt;&gt;,
the example above is equivalent to::

    @ This method puts an open node sentinel for node v.
    @c
    def putOpenNodeSentinel(self,v):
        if v.isAtFileNode() and v != self.root:
            &lt;&lt; issue an error message &gt;&gt;
        else:
            s = self.nodeSentinelText(v)
            self.putSentinel("@+node:" + s)

We may not eliminate @c directives in @root trees.
If we convert the doc part to a comment we are left with::

    @c
    # This method puts an open node sentinel for node v.
    def putOpenNodeSentinel(self,v):
        if v.isAtFileNode() and v != self.root:
            &lt;&lt; issue an error message &gt;&gt;
        else:
            s = self.nodeSentinelText(v)
            self.putSentinel("@+node:" + s)

The following escape convention applies only in @root trees.
Within a code part @@ in the first column (and only in the first column) stands for a single @ sign.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.48">Each @root tree represents a single external file. **Tangling** is the process
of creating external files from @file, @thin or @root trees. Leo tangles @file
and @thin trees automatically whenever an outline is saved. The user must tangle
@root trees explicitly using one of the Tangle commands.

Leo creates external files by expanding all section references in an @root node.
Leo expands a section reference by substituting the code section itself for the
section reference. This is a recursive process: the substituted code section may
contain other code references which are themselves expanded, and so on.

The outline provides a natural way of organizing an sections as follows::

	Place the definition of a section S in a child of
	the node containing the reference to S.

If a section is referenced in more than one node, I usually place its definition
in a node containing all the nodes that refer to it. Using this rule of thumb
creates an outline whose structure mirrors the intrinsic organization of a
program.

The Tangle command creates external files from @root node. The @root directive
indicates which sections constitute an output file. The text following a @root
directive forms the entire content of the file, that is, after section
references are expanded. An outline can contain arbitrarily many @root
directives: Leo's Tangle commands will create one output file for each. The
process of creating external files is called "tangling" because the code from
the outline is rearranged to create the external files.

For example, the following @root section shows a typical way of specifying a
header file xx.h::

    @root xx.h
    #ifndef xx_defined
    #define xx_defined
    &lt;&lt; declarations of public constants of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; declarations of public types of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; declarations of public variables of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; public prototypes of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    #endif

The Tangle commands will create the file xx.h from this body text by expanding
all the section references. Incidentally, the introductory documentation will be
included in the header file: any text preceding the @root directive is treated
just like the doc part of a section definition.

As another example, the following shows a typical way of specifying the
corresponding xx.c file::

    @root xx.c
    &lt;&lt; public variables of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; private types of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; private variables of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; private function prototypes of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; methods of the xx class &gt;&gt;

There are three menu commands that tangle an outline: Tangle, Tangle All and
Tangle Marked. These commands are identical except for how much of the outline
is tangled. The Tangle command tangles only the selected portion of the outline,
the Tangle All command tangles the entire outline, and the Tangle Marked command
tangles only marked headlines.

The @root directive has three forms. All three forms mean exactly the same
thing::

    @root filename
    @root "filename"
    @root &lt;filename&gt;

If *filename* is an absolute filename the location of the external file is specified only by the filename.
Otherwise, if the @root node contains a relative filename, the location of the external file is relative to:

1. the directory specified by an @path directive, or

2. the default_tangle_directory setting if no @path directive is in effect, or

3. the directory in which the .leo resides if the .leo file has ever been saved.

An error occurs if no absolute path can be computed according to these rules,
or if the filename or directory does not exist.

The scope of a definition is the tree in which the definition is known. By
default, Tangle commands look for section definitions only in the suboutline of
the @root node being tangled. That is, all sections are assumed to be defined
either in the body text of the headline, say h, containing the @root directive,
or in the body texts of the descendants of h. The @unit directive explicitly
indicates the scope of section definitions. When a Tangle command encounters the
@unit directive it treats the suboutline containing the @unit command as the
scope for all enclosed roots. This ensures that the group of roots in the
subtree use the same section definitions.

For example, suppose we have a tree organized as follows::

	+ @unit
		+ @root A
		    sections in A
		+ @root B
		    sections in B

The @unit directive insures that only sections defined in the unit can affect
files A and B and that all sections definitions in A and B are compatible with
each other.

The Tangle commands ignore any tree containing an @ignore directive. This
ensures that trees that contain cloned nodes or other subsidiary information do
not cause the tangle commands to issue spurious error messages. It also ensures
that a tree can never contribute a section definition to another part of the
outline by mistake.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.49">The Untangle, Untangle All and Untangle Marked commands are the reverse of the
corresponding Tangle commands. They update one or more @root nodes based on
changes made to the corresponding external files.

For example, suppose you create a new part of the outline and tangle it for the
first time. When you compile external files for the first you are likely to get
many syntax errors. You could fix those errors in the outline and tangle the
outline again, but there is a much easier way: you fix the errors in the
external files using the compiler's editor, then run the untangle command on the
part of the outline that created the external file. The Untangle command updates
the selected outline to match the changes in the external files. It's as simple
as that. By the way, the Untangle command marks all the nodes in the outline
that it updates, and you can examine all such nodes with the Go To Next Marked
command in the Outline menu.

You cannot use Untangle to update doc parts, or leading comments in code parts
or "trivial" whitespace in code parts. This is a limitation of the Untangle
command that cannot be fixed; Untangle has no way of knowing whether leading
comments came from doc parts or are just leading comments.

Untangle never changes the structure of an outline; it never inserts, deletes or
moves nodes. Don't attempt to change the structure of an outline by modifying
external files; it won't work. Also, never delete, move or alter the sentinel
lines in external files written by the Tangle command. Such lines start with the
comment delimiter followed by a section name.

If you change the section name in a sentinel line Untangle will not update the
code in the outline (with the old name) that generated the renamed section.
Untangle warns about sections that appear in an external file but not in the
outline. Untangle has no trouble with changed section references in external
files; it is only changed sentinel lines that cause problems.

Cloned nodes that generate code in several files may cause problems for
Untangle. If Untangle is run separately on these external files, Untangle will
update all cloned nodes each time it is run, so only the code in the last
Untangle run will take effect. Therefore, the safe way to update text in cloned
nodes is to make the change in the .leo file rather than the external files.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.50">The @verbose, @terse, @quiet and @silent directives determine
how the Tangle command outputs comments in @root trees.
Comments written by the user in code sections are always output.
These directives control only:
a) the comments containing doc sections and
b) sentinel comments that delimit the beginning and end of code sections.

When @verbose is in effect Tangle outputs all comments.
When @terse is in effect, Tangle outputs only those comments necessary for Untangle to work.
When @silent is in effect Tangle adds no additional comments.
The @quiet directive is like @silent except that it does output leading sentinels as comments.
Like @silent, @quiet inhibits untangling. 
@verbose is the default.
If more than one of these directives appear in the same body text the "most verbose" of these options will be in effect.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.51">The @file is a synonym for @thin. The @file directive creates an external file
containing sentinels.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828062751">In the following table all terms in each row are equivalent.

Leo can not update the outline from changes made from external files unless
those files contain sentinels. The primary source for @nosent and @asis trees
are the outlines from which those files were created.

For @shadow trees, Leo creates *two* files, a **public** file without sentinels,
and a **private** file (by default in the .leo_shadow subfolder) containing
sentinels. The primary sources for @shadow trees are the private files, updated
by changes to the public file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828064254">The @others directive refers to the body text of all nodes *except* section
definition nodes. The @others directive places the body text of section
definition nodes in the external file in outline order.

An @file or @thin tree may contain more than one @others directive. @others
directives that descend from other @others directives refer only to unnamed
nodes that descend from them. The @others directive that occurs highest in the
@file tree refers to all other unnamed nodes.

**Notes**:

- No node may contain more than one @others directive.

- No section definition node may intervene between an non-section definition
  node containing body text and an @others node. In practice this is never a
  problem.

- The @others directive is not valid in @root or @unit trees.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828065955.3">Generally speaking, @ignore directive prevents nodes from being processed.

1. In the root node of any @auto, @edit, @file, @nosent, @root, @thin or @shadow tree, 
   the @ignore directive prevents Leo from writing the external file. 

2. @auto trees are an exception.  Everything, including @ignore directives, are written.
   However, you can disable the writing of an @auto tree by putting an @ignore directive in an
   ancestor of the @auto tree.

3. At present, @ignore can be used to prevent the inclusion of a node that descends from @others.
   This may be dubious behavior, but that's how Leo works.

4. @ignore can be used by scripts and plugins as they like, but should preserve the behavior in item 1 above.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050828163557">You create and use external files using @&lt;file&gt; directives.
Most of these directives may only appear in headlines.
Here are all the ways of creating external files:

\@asis
  This directive copies body text verbatim, without even ensuring that
  newlines terminate each node. Use this directive only when you must have
  complete control over every character of the external file.

\@auto
  Imports the external file when Leo reads an outline. See the `@auto
  reference`_ for full details.

\@edit
  Reads the external file into a single node.

\@file
  As of Leo 4.7 b2, @file works exactly like @thin.  See below.

\@thin
  Creates external files containing sentinels that minimize conflicts
  in source code control systems such as bzr.
  Use @thin unless you have a good reason not to.

\@nosent
  Creates external files without sentinels.
  Use @nosent only as a last resort:
  @auto or @shadow are usually a better choice.
  Leo can not update @nosent trees from changes made to the external files.

  The @bool force_newlines_in_at_nosent_bodies setting
  controls whether Leo writes a trailing newline if non-empty body text does not
  end in a newline. The default is True. In effect, the default value of this
  setting was False in previous versions of Leo.

\@root
  This directive is the most flexible, and the most difficult to use.
  **Note**: @root is a true directive: you put @root in body text.
  Historically, this was the first directive that created external files.
  It comes closest in spirit to traditional literate programming tools.
  However, it is seldom necessary to suffer the drawbacks of using @root.
  My advice is to avoid using @root unless you have a compelling reason.

\@shadow
   This directive writes *two* external files, a **public** file without sentinels,
   and a **private** file (by default in the .leo_shadow subfolder) containing sentinels.
   This allows Leo to get the benefits of @thin trees,
   without having sentinels in the public files that people care about.

To complicate matters further,
you can use `CWEB`_ markup instead of `noweb`_ markup.
See the section called `CWEB mode`_ for the details.
The choice between CWEB and noweb is independent of the directive is used to create external files.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828173234">The @ directive starts a doc part.
Doc parts continue until an @c directive or the end of the body text.
For example::

    @ This is a comment in a doc part.
    Doc parts can span multiple lines.
    The next line ends the doc part
    @c

@doc is a synonym for @, but @ is preferred.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828173234.1">The @c directive ends a doc part and begins a code part.
@code is a synonym for @c, but @c is preferred.

In @root and @unit trees, the headline must contain a valid section name.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828174453.1">Leo writes @nosent trees just as for @thin trees,
but Leo writes no sentinels at all.

The @bool force_newlines_in_at_nosent_bodies setting
controls whether Leo writes a trailing newline if non-empty body text does not
end in a newline. The default is True. In effect, the default value of this
setting was False in previous versions of Leo.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828174453.2">Leo creates files from @asis trees by writing the body text of all nodes of the
tree in outline order. Leo writes the body text *as is*, without recognizing
section definitions, without expanding section references, and without treating
directives specially in any way. In particular, Leo copies all directives,
including @ or @c directives, to the external file as text.

Leo does recognize the @ignore directive in the *ancestors* of @asis nodes, so
you may use the @ignore directive as usual to prevent Leo from writing @asis
trees.

**Notes**:

- Within @asis trees only, if a headline starts with @@, Leo writes
  everything in the headline following the @@ just before the corresponding
  body text.

- Files created from @asis trees contain *nothing* not contained in body
  text (or @@ headlines). In particular, if body text does not end in a
  newline, the first line from the next node will concatenated to the last line
  of the preceding node.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828210721">The @last directive allows you to place lines at the very end of external files
created from @file and @thin nodes. The @last directive is recognized only at
the end of body text of @file and @thin nodes. No text may follow @last
directives. More than one @last directive may exist. For example, here is how a
PHP file might be set up::

	@first &lt;?php
	...
	@last ?&gt;</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828210721.1">The @pagewidth directive overrides the page_width setting.
The form of the @pagewidth directive is @pagewidth *n*,
where n is a positive integer that indicates the width of tangled pages in columns.
For example::

    @pagewidth 100

This setting only affects how Leo reformats doc parts, and how the Tangle command outputs block comments.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828210721.2">The @tabwidth directive overrides the tab_width setting.
The form of the @tabwidth directive is @tabwidth *n*,
where n is a positive integer that indicates the width of tabs in spaces.
For example::

    @tabwidth -4

Negative values cause Leo to convert tabs to blanks.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828211507">Here is a brief summary of each directive:

- **\@**
  Starts a doc part. @doc is a deprecated synonym.

- **\@all**
  Copies *all* descendant nodes to the external file.
  Not valid in @root trees.

- **\@asis**
  Creates an external file without sentinels,
  containing exactly the data in the @asis tree,
  without expanding section references or @others directives.

- **\@auto**
  Imports the external file every time Leo reads the outline.
  The read-at-auto-nodes and write-at-auto-nodes commands can
  be used to read and write and @auto nodes.

- **\@c**
  Starts a code part. @code is a deprecated synonym.

- **\@color**, **\@nocolor**, **\@nocolor-node** and **\@killcolor**
  Control syntax coloring.

- **\@comment**
  Sets comment delimiters in @root and @unit trees.

- **\@delims**
  Sets comment delimiters in @thin and @file trees.

- **\@edit**
  Reads an external file into a single node.

- **\@encoding**
  Sets the Unicode encoding used in external files.

- **\@file**
  A synonym for @thin.

- **\@first**
  Forces lines to appear before the first sentinel of an external file.

- **\@ignore**
  Causes Leo to ignore all or part of an external file.

- **\@language**
  Sets the language used for syntax coloring **and**
  sets the comment delimiters used in sentinel lines and in doc parts.

- **\@last**
  Forces lines to appear after the last sentinel of an external file.

- **\@lineending**
  Sets the line ending to be used in external files.

- **\@others**
  Copies all nodes *except* section definition nodes to the external file.

- **\@nosent**
  Same as @thin, but the external file contains no sentinels.

- **\@pagewidth**
  Sets the page width used to break doc parts into lines.

- **\@path**
  Set the path to be appended to filenames.

- **\@raw** and **\@end_raw**
  Delimit a section of 'raw' text.
  Not valid in @root or @unit trees.

- **\@root**, **\@root-code** and **\@root-code**
  Start an @root tree.
  The last two forms set the starting mode for body text.

- **\@shadow**
  Creates two external files, a **public** file without sentinels,
  and a **private** file containing sentinels.
  Imports the file just as @auto does if the private file does not exist.

- **\@tabwidth**
  Sets the width of tabs.
  Negative tab widths cause Leo to convert tabs to spaces.

- **\@thin**
  Creates an external file containing sentinels.
  Thin external files miminize cvs and bzr conflicts.
  All essential information is stored in the thin external file.

- **@verbose**, **@terse**, **@quiet** and **@silent**
  Set the verbosity of sentinels in external files from @root.

- **\@wrap** and **\@nowrap**
  Enable or disable line wrapping the Leo's body pane.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.12">September 3, 2002

Hello, my full name is David Speed Ream. I am known as Speed to friends and
enemies alike, but I gladly answer to David or most any other handle. I am an
unabashed and biased fan of Leo, the fact that it was written by my brother
Edward only slightly coloring my already colored glasses. I have been testing
and using Leo in software production for over 4 years. My company currently has
over 50,000 lines of code in over 100 source files that are written using Leo.

My comments are from two points of view, the first being software project
manager for a complicated, multi-module software product, and the second being
as a production line coder. For me, Leo’s greatest and only real drawback is the
learning curve. This learning curve can be shallow is if all that is required is
that someone code using Leo. However, in our company we allocate 40 to 80 hours
*on top* of the normal coding load for someone to come up to speed on Leo. The
ROI (return on investment) is calculated by me to be on the order of 3 months.
So if I hire a consultant for less than 3 months, I don’t teach him Leo, even
though all source code in our company must reside in Leo files for the reasons I
won’t go into now.

I consider that my coders are 15 to 30 percent more efficient in their daily
operations than my competition’s people. This indefensible claim of mine is
based on the changes in my productivity as Leo grew from a test document
production tool to the primary production method for all our assembly, c and cpp
source code.

Personally, I hate to deal with documentation when I write code, except:

1) When I am first sitting down to solve a new problem.
   Then the documentation becomes quite long-winded and pontificatory,
   as if I were the only one on earth smart enough to solve the problem - or
2) When I come back to code I or someone else has written and find the documentation insufficient to
   understand the code without study (seems to be most of the time).

So I do not require my engineers or myself to do a great job of documentation,
nor do I use Leo for that purpose. Rather, it is Leo’s outlining and organizing
ability, and Leo’s ability to create source files from within the outline that
give me what I think is a tremendous competitive advantage. Each of my company’s
products run on all versions of windows from Win 3.1 to XP. In our flagship
software piece, there are ten main modules, and each module is maintained by one
single Leo file. In the CODEC module, one Leo file named compress.leo organizes
and creates seven .asm files, forty-four .c files, twenty .h files, two .def
files, four .mak files, etc. etc. etc. This one file can be checked out from
source code control and given to an engineer for the addition of a new feature.

In it are contained all the known issues for the CODEC, each issue arranged in
its own clone section. One clone section groups together every routine, variable
or type definition that must change between different versions of Windows. These
sections could be from six different c source files, two assembly files, and
eight .h files. Another clone section groups together those sections relating to
memory problems, which change according to the memory configuration and TSR
configuration (or lack thereof) on the target machine. Another clone section
groups sections that fail (or don’t fail) if the routine in question was
accidentally run during the dreaded ‘interrupt time’. Another clone section is a
section containing clones, each of which is named after the major bug that was
fixed when the engineer who fixed the bug grouped a bunch of routines,
definitions, etc. together to fix the bug.

None of the above clone sections was ‘designed’ into the document. Just the
opposite happens. When the codec was first written, there was just a single Leo
file with a bunch of sections for each c routine or assembly module. As the
product grew and was tested on various platforms, each failure of the module was
organized into clones each time a failure was fixed. This is what I call “SELF
DOCUMENTING CODE”. This has nothing to do with me sitting and documenting
anything. Its just that the STRUCTURE of a bug fix (or product enhancement)
lives on long after the coding is done, as long as no one is foolish enough to
delete the cloned sections that ‘DOCUMENT’ what happened.

In actual practice, this organizational ‘history’ is so powerful that I can’t
begin to describe it. A ‘REVERSE LEARNING CURVE’ happens when an engineer gets a
Leo file that already has the ‘interrupt time sensitive’ routines grouped
together by the last unfortunate soul who had to work on them. There may not be
any more written documentation, but the knowledge contained in the structure can
be breathtaking. It is certainly time saving. I find this particularly true in
my own case. Often I’ll look at some code that seems totally unfamiliar and
think ‘what idiot wrote this crap’. Then I’ll look at the version control
comments and realize that I wrote the crap. Then for sure I know the
documentation is non-existent, but the clones I used to develop it are still
there, and they always serve to refresh my memory in an indescribable way.

Enough of this commentary, I just looked at the clock. Best wishes to anyone
willing to try Leo for a week. I hope you will be glad you did.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.13">The Word outlines are very useful. But Leo makes Word look like a clunky toy.

#1 Reason would probably be clone nodes. One node can point to another. Another
way of putting this is is that a leaf can be on more than one tree. For
example, suppose you have a list of recipes. You simultaneously put a single
recipe under multiple categories or even multiple hierarchies. You could put "3
bean enchilada" simultaneously under Recipes-Mexican and Food-Gas. Another
example would be, if you are a biologist trying to decide under which genus to
put a new species, you could put the species under two simultaneously. In
effect, you can build a 3-D tree. For a further illustration see
http://www.3dtree.com/ev/e/sbooks/leo/sbframetoc_ie.htm

#2 Reason would probably be that Leo outlines can be embedded in external text
files. So, a Leo outline is more than an outline, it is a meta-structure that
can be added to another text without changing that text, but rather providing
an external road map to the text. Microsoft Word has a text (xml) version with a
commenting convention, so Leo can even be used to add outlines into Word docs,
although it isn't set up to do that now. For example, see
http://www.3dtree.com/ev/e/sbooks/leo/sbframetoc_ie.htm In this case, the upper
window of Leo is the meta-structure, and the bottom window is the file to which
the meta-structure is being applied, viewed one node at a time.

I may not have made #2 very clear, but it is actually a very useful feature. It
takes some getting used to before one sees all of the possibilities tho. One
way to think of it is that Leo allows you to throw external documents into your
outline, and yet the external document remains independent and can still be
edited separately.

Some other cool things about Leo which Word doesn't feature:
1. Pure xml output that is easy to transform into other formats (next
version of Word will have true XML format, but not as easy to work with).
One consequence of this is that Leo files can be transformed pretty easily
to web pages with their outlining capability intact.
2. Easy to add features since is programmed in Tk and open source. Maybe
your average user can't start hacking on it, but a surprising amount can be
tacked on by flipping through the Tk manual.
3. Free, opensource, multi-platform
4. Leo is scriptable with Python. It should be possible to build a Tickler
into Leo using Python scripting, for example.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.14">First of all, kudos to you for the excellent progress you've been making with
Leo. I upgraded today after about three months of using and older version and I
was thrilled to see all the great improvements that have happened so fast. I
especially love the ability to go to next clone. I think you're really showing
what open source can do and your current trajectory puts you on track to kick
Emacs into the dustbin of computing history.

So today I copied all my data (personal information manager and project
management stuff) out of my old outliner (ThoughtManager, which syncs with and
runs on the Palm) and put it into Leo. It took me hours to do it and then to
rearrange it the way I really wanted it. But having the ability to make clones
and have different ways to view my data is, as you know, fabulous. In my case,
for personal information and project management things, I used the flexibility
of clones to allow me to see my data in several different views: 1) by project,
the logical hierarchical breakdown by topic, 2) by person, so whenever I'm
talking to someone I can easily see all the pending items related to them which
may be spread over multiple projects, 3) by priority, so I can see what needs to
get done sooner and what can wait for later and, 4) a special case of priority
called "Today" for the things I'm going to focus on in the coming hours.

Now here's why I don't miss the ability of my old outliner to synch the entire
outline with the Palm. It turns out the main thing I really want in the Palm is
the top category "Today" so all I have to do is have Leo flatten that one
heading into a text file (and it kindly remembers the name and directory of the
file I used last time) and then I'm done because I've told the Palm Hotsync
manager that that file should be sent to Palm memo pad every time I synch. The
Palm Hotsync manager does a nice job of sending a text file to the Palm memo pad
and even breaks the file up into multiple memo records if it's too big to fit in
just one. So that gives me enough to be able to browse (or full text search) the
small amount of data that I really want right inside my Palm (which is also my
cell phone). Quick and dirty but it works.

For times when I want my whole outline with me, Leo wins again because thanks to
its cross platform nature I can take my whole outline with me on my Mac iBook,
even though I usually edit it on a Windows PC (which is the only kind of machine
my old outliner would run on). Quite frankly, although my old outliner was able
to shoehorn the whole thing into my palm/cellphone, it was a pain to access it
on the small screen and slow processor. Now when I anticipate I'll need the
whole thing, for example when I'm going to a meeting, I can put it on my Mac
iBook (under X and Fink for now until Python can do it native under Aqua) and
have real, full access to it all.

I think now in addition to being great for programming Leo is also a great PIM.
Being able to flatten a strategically chosen portion of the outline into a known
file name that the Palm synch manager has been told to send to the Palm on every
synch does the trick for me. I wonder if you would consider something like an
@flatten directive so I can have that done automatically for me every time I
save my outline? For now it's up to me to flatten the node I want manually,
although once I've done that the transfer to the Palm is automatic.

You're my hero! Thank you so much.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.15">Another day, another breakthrough using Leo -- now I realize Leo is the 
best URL bookmark manager there is.  No more bookmarks menus or 
favorites lists inside the browser for me.  With the @url directive I 
can just double click on the URL to open it in my browser.  Leo lets me 
arrange the URLs in a hierarchy (or multiple hierarchies), attach notes 
to them, save clippings of things I read on the sites.  It's sooo much 
better than anything the browsers have built in and it lets me easily 
use different browsers on different platforms and different machines 
(try that with the browsers' built-in bookmark managers).  

When using Leo as a project manager and personal information manager as 
I do I can heavily annotate every task and project with helpful and 
relevant URLs.  And since URLs can be of the file:// form, they're not 
just for web pages or HTML documents;  I can link to any file on my disk 
of any type to be opened by any program.

Leo is a quantum leap for me in terms of how many projects I can manage 
and how much information I can find and organize and store in a useful 
way.  I'm a data-mining army of one now and the web is my playground. 
Every time I find a web page that has interesting links to others, 
those links get stored in my Leo outline too, right where I can find 
them and make practical use of them.  I can easily accept dozens of 
valuable links every day and integrate them into what I'm doing in a way 
that I'm confidant they won't get lost or forgotten.  Before I always 
used to get bogged down by the difficulty of managing bookmarks inside 
the browser.  But now I'm no longer the victim of information overload 
buried in the knowledge landslide of the Internet;  instead I'm the 
professional strip miner with the world's biggest bulldozer.  I eagerly 
plunge into mountains of data and emerge with all the valuable 
information nuggets neatly stored and organized.  And my storehouse of 
knowledge is a flexible thing where I can reorganize and prioritize and 
massage the data to my heart's content as I learn more about it and 
decide to use it in different ways for different purposes.  It's the 
difference between the pick axe and the steam shovel for me.

<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.16">This year my accountant is getting a beautiful printout generated by LaTeX and
Leo. I have a complicated tax situation this year, but I got it all laid out and
organized in Leo. Then I had each of the nodes that had something my accountant
needs to see write the data out to a file in the form a LaTeX table.

Sometimes a row of a table would have a result that was calculated by adding up
a list of numbers. For that I used the modern day equivalent of an adding
machine paper tape -- I stored a lisp s-expression in a Leo comment. I like
s-expressions for this because once I put the opening "(+" on one line and the
closing ")" on another line, I can fill in additional numbers just by typing
them and can even annotate them with comments. So in the middle of generating a
LaTeX file I might have something like this::

    @
    (+
    1165.26 1823.70 ; May 2002
    123.38 ; June 2002
    13.50 ; July 2002
    13.21 ; October 2002
    55.25 ; November 2002
    )
    @c

That's an annotated record of how I arrived at the number the accountant will
actually see. I can just paste it into any lisp or scheme interpreter and get
the total. Adding additional numbers is easy.

For next year, I think I might take this a step further. What I did this year is
good for adding up numbers to get a total for one row of a LaTeX table. But it
turns out I'd also like some more processing done on those tables (which I had
to do by hand this time) -- I'd like the rows sorted in reverse order by
magnitude (so that the big numbers jump out at you from the start of the tables)
and I'd like a total of all the rows in the table. So I think next year, instead
of having an s-expression that computes the total of one row for me, I think
I'll use s-expressions that generate whole tables, formatted for LaTex, from the
underlying data. So I'm thinking next year my s-expressions might look more like
this::

    @
    (table "Widget Related Expenses"
        ("widget insurance" (+
                        1165.26 1823.70 ; May 2002

                        13.21 ; October 2002
                        55.25 ; November 2002
                      ))
         ("widget shipping" (+
                        472.15 651.94 ; May 2002
                        54 ; June 2002
                       ))
         ("widget cleaning" (+
                        165.26 183.70 ; May 2002
                        123.38 ; June 2002
                        13.50 ; July 2002

                       ))
    )
    @c

The job of that "table" function would be to return the LaTeX code needed to
display a table with the category names and values, sorted descending by
magnitude, with the total displayed. It's sort of a poor man's way of doing a
spreadsheet inside Leo and then making it look great using LaTeX. The idea would
be as I wanted to add more data, I'd add it to the s-expression and then
reevaluate the whole thing by pasting it into a lisp interpreter and then
copying the result back into the same Leo node for LaTeX to process.

<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.10">The encoding used in the file being imported doesn't match the encoding in effect for Leo.
You have two options:

- Use the @encoding directive_ in an ancestor of the node_ selected when
  doing the Import command_ to specify the encoding of file to be imported.

- Set the tk_encoding setting_ (see the previous answer) to the encoding you normally use.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.113">**Question**:
It would be nice if Leo could open empty files. I tend to be "document oriented"
rather than "application oriented" in my thinking and prefer "create empty file
at location -&gt; open it with program" to "start program -&gt; create new file -&gt;
save it at location".

**Answer** by Paul Paterson:
If you are on Windows 98/2000/XP then the procedure is as follows...

1. Start Leo
2. Click New
3. Click Save as...
4. Save the file as "c:\windows\shellnew\leofile.leo" (or c:\winnt for 2000/XP)
5. Open regedit "start...run...regedit"
6. Open HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and find the ".leo" extension type
7. Go New ... Key from the context menu 
8. Call the new key ShellNew 
9. Select the new key, right-click, choose New...String Value from the context menu
10. Call it FileName 
11. Double-click on the string, and modify it to be the filename of the leofile.leo file you created,
    including the extension
12. Exit the registry editor and restart Windows Explorer (you may need to reboot on Windows 98)

Now you should have a New:Leo File option in Explorer. This creates a duplicate
of the file you saved. This can be useful because you could make a template Leo
file containing some standard nodes_ that you always have and then save this.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.114">By Dave Hein: The cause of the keymapping problem is a issue with the X11
keyboard mapping, not with Tk. If you have this problem on your system, issue
the command::

    xmodmap -pke 

and look in the results for the line for keycode 22. I'll bet it shows something like::

    keycode 22 = BackSpace Terminate_Server

That second token ("Terminate_Server") is what is supposed to be mapped to
Shift-Backspace. You want this second token to be either not present or to be
BackSpace. To fix this, create a file (e.g. .Xmodmap) and give it the content::

    keycode 22 = BackSpace

then run the command::

    xmodmap .Xmodmap

This fixes the problem. On my system this also disables the ability to terminate
the X server using Ctrl-Alt-BackSpace. This is because of some conflict with xdb
(xdb is the newer keyboard mapping facility in XFree86; xmodmap is the old
original X11 keyboard mapping facility). I'm still working on that. I'm also not
able to get xmodmap to make this change during X11 startup (again because of
conflicts with xdb). But I'm working on that as well.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.115">For the most part, docutils_ does a good job of reporting errors. docutils_ prints
a message to the console and inserts an unmistakable error message in the
generated .html file.
**Important**: On Windows it is helpful to `run Leo in a console window`_.

However, in some cases, docutils_ crashes instead of properly reporting the
problem. There are several workarounds:

1.  The crashes I have seen arise from the following bug in docutils.
    **Hyperlinks in image:: markup must be lower case**.  This will work::

        .. .. |back| image:: arrow_lt.gif
            :target: faq_

    This will **crash**::

        .. .. |back| image:: arrow_lt.gif
            :target: FAQ_

    So avoid this crash by making sure to use lower case targets in ':target:' markup.

2.  You can change the docutils_ source slightly so that it prints a traceback when it
    crashes. (The rst3 plugin should be able to do this, but I haven't figured
    out how yet.) It's easy enough to do this:

    - Find the file core.py in top-level docutils folder.
      Typically this folder will be in Python's site-packages folder.

    - Open core.py in some editor other than Leo.

    - Find the method called report_Exceptions.

    - Insert the following lines at the very start of this method::

        print 'EKR: added traceback'
        import traceback ; traceback.print_exc()

    This will cause a traceback whenever docutils_ crashes. I have found that
    such tracebacks are generally enough to locate the general area of the
    problem. **Note**: These tracebacks go to the console window, so you should
    `run Leo in a console window`_.

3.  As a last resort, you can isolate syntax errors by reducing your input files
    until they work again, then adding sections until you get a crash. This is
    easy enough to do (when using the rst3 plugin) by change a headline 'x' to
    @rst-ignore-tree x.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.116">From: http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3240374
Using Leo's File-Export-Flatten Outline commands creates a MORE style outline which places
all Leo body sections on the left margin.
The headlines_ are indented with tabs which Excel will read as a tab delimited format.
Once inside Excel there are benefits.

1.  The most obvious benefit inside Excel is that the body sections (Excel first
    column) can be selected easily and highlighted with a different font color.
    This makes the MORE format very readable. Save a copy of your sheet as HTML
    and now you have a web page with the body sections highlighted.

2.  It is possible to hide columns in Excel.
    Hiding the first column leaves just the headlines showing.

3.  Formulas based on searching for a string can do calculations in Excel.
    For example if a heading "Current Assets" appears on level 4 then the body formula::

        =INDEX(A:A,MATCH("Current Assets",D:D,0)+1)

    will retrieve it. The +1 after match looks down one row below the matched
    headline. The trick is to place all your headlines in quotes because Excel
    will see + "Current Assets" from the MORE outline. When Excel tries
    without the quotes it thinks it is a range name and displays a #N/A
    error instead of the headline. Also you must place a child node_ below to
    get the + sign instead of a - sign which would give a MORE headline of
    -"Current assets" , also is an error.

I think there is some interesting possibility here because of the enforcement of
Leo body text being always in the first column. The Leo outline provides
additional reference to organizing the problem not typical of spreadsheet
models. Beyond scripting in Python, Excel is good at doing interrelated
calculations and detecting problems like circular references. In Excel
Tools-Options-General is a setting for r1c1 format which then shows numbers
instead of letters for column references. Using this would allow entries like
this in the leo body::

    1000
    3500
    =R[-1]C+R[-2]C

In Excel you would see 4500 below those two numbers. This is completely
independent of where the block of three cells exists on the sheet.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.117">Python's decorator_ syntax is ill-conceived.
This syntax file hack works well enough anyway to work with Leo '@' markup::

    syn region leoComment start="^@\s*" end="^@c\s*$"
    syn match   pythonDecorator	"@\S\S+" display nextgroup=pythonFunction skipwhite</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.119">By Rich Ries.
I often rework C code that's already been "Leo-ized"--the first pass was quick
and dirty to get it going. When I do subsequent passes, I wind up with subnodes
that are out of order with the sequence found in the main node_. It's not a big
deal, but I like 'em ordered. With just one editor pane, clicking on the node_ to
move would switch focus to that node_. I'd then need to re-focus on the main
node_. A minor nuisance, but it does slow you down.

My solution is to open a second editor with its focus on the main node_. Switch
to the other editor, and, referring to the first editor pane, move the nodes as
you like. The second editor's pane will change focus to the node_ you're moving,
but the first editor will stay focused on the main node_. It's a lot easier to
do than to describe!

<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.12">Using @thin trees can eliminate most problems with using Leo in cooperative
(SCCS) environments:

- Developers should use @thin trees to create external files in any kind of
  cooperative environment.

- If sentinels are frowned upon in your development community, use @auto or
  @shadow instead of @thin.

- The repository contains **reference** .leo files. These reference files should
  contain nothing but @thin nodes. Reference files should change only when
  new external files get added to the project. Leo's `bzr repository`_ and Leo
  distributions contain the following reference files: LeoPyRef.leo,
  LeoPluginsRef.leo and leoGuiPluginsRef.leo. Developers should use
  local copies of reference files for their own work. For example, instead of
  using LeoPyRef.leo directly, I use a copy called LeoPy.leo.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.120">One way is to link directly to the media file from a Leo node_ (with @url)
and write a scriptbutton to wrap all URL-nodes under the current node_ in a
single HTML page (using the HTML browser trick at
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1201579&amp;forum_id=10226).

Then, you can view your media in two ways:

-   Individually. You can directly click on the @url link to display the media
    in the browser (assuming you have your MIME/filetype associations set up
    correctly for your browser).

-   In a group. You can click on a script button (you have to code this yourself,
    very simple) which should collect all @url nodes_ under the current node_
    and dynamically generate a HTML page displaying either links to or embedded
    versions of the media (using the HTML trick described above to invoke the
    browser). This way, you can create collections of @url nodes under a
    single node_ (like a bookmark folder), and press a single button to view the
    @url collection as a single entity in the browser (with all browser
    capabilities like displaying the media).

You could probably generalize this idea of "collect all @url nodes under current
node_ and display as HTML in browser" into a general-purpose plugin. However,
the plugin would have to be somewhat smart in mapping a link to its corresponding
HTML code (e.g. an image link gets mapped to an &lt;img&gt; HTML tag, a link to a
Flash file gets mapped to an &lt;embed&gt; tag, etc).</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.13"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.14">You have two options, depending on whether you want to be able to use sections
or not.

-   Use @nosent trees.
    Files derived from @nosent trees contain no sentinels_.
    However, Leo create the external file just as in @thin trees.
    In particular, Leo expands section references and understands the @others directive.

-   Use @asis trees.
    Files derived from @asis trees contain no sentinels_.
    Moreover, Leo does not expand section references in asis trees.
    In other words, Leo creates the `external file` simply by writing all body text in outline order.
    Leo can't update the outline unless the external file contains sentinels,
    so Leo does not update @nosent trees or @asis trees automatically when
    you change the external file in an external editor.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.16">Use @asis trees. Files derived from @asis trees contain no sentinels. Leo
creates the external file simply by writing all body text in outline order. Leo

does not update @asis trees automatically when you change the external file in
an external editor.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.17">The import commands insert @ignore directives_ in the top-level node_.
Leo does this so that you won't accidentally overwrite your files after importing them.
Change the filename following @thin or @root as desired,
then remove the @ignore directive_.
Saving the outline will then create the external file.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.18">**Question**: I'm writing a Windows Script Component, which is an XML file with
a CData section containing javascript. I can get the XML as I want it by using
\@language html, but how can I get the tangling comments inside the CData
section to be java-style comments rather than html ones?

**Answer**: In @thin trees you use the @delims directive to change comment delimiters.
For example::

    @delims /* */ 
    Javascript stuff 
    @delims &lt;-- --&gt; 
    HTML stuff

**Important**: Leo can not revert to previous delimiters automatically;
you must change back to previous delimiters using another @delims directive_.

In @root trees you can work around this problem using the @silent directive_.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.19">By Zvi Boshernitzan: I was having trouble disabling '&lt;?php' with comments (and
couldn't override the comment character for the start of the page). Finally, I
found a solution that worked, using php's heredoc string syntax::

    @first &lt;?php
    @first $comment = &lt;&lt;&lt;EOD
    EOD;

    // php code goes here.
    echo "boogie";

    $comment2 = &lt;&lt;&lt;EOD
    @last EOD;
    @last ?&gt;

or::

    @first &lt;?php
    @first /*
    */

    echo "hi";

    @delims /* */
    @last ?&gt;</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.2">First, read the tutorial_. This will be enough to get you started if you just
want to use Leo as an outliner_. If you intend to use Leo for programming, read
the `Quick start for programmers`_, then look at Leo's source code in the file LeoPy.leo.
Spend 5 or 10 minutes browsing through the outline. Don't worry about details;
just look for the following common usage patterns:

-   The (Projects) tree shows how to use clones to represent tasks.

-   Study @thin leoNodes.py.
    It shows how to define more than one class in single file.

-   Most other files show how to use a single @others directive to define one class.

-   Most methods are defined using @others, *not* section definition nodes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.20">Here is a posting which might be helpful:
http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2300457 The @first
directive_ is the key to output usable code in unsupported languages. For
example, to use Leo with the Basic language, use the following::

    @first $IFDEF LEOHEADER
    @delims '
    @c
    $ENDIF

So this would enable a basic compiler to "jump" over the "true" LEO-header-lines.
Like this::

    $IFDEF LEOHEADER &lt;-conditional compilation directive 
    #@+leo-ver=4 &lt;-these lines not compiled
    #@+node:@file QParser005.INC
    #@@first
    #@delims ' 
    '@@c
    $ENDIF &lt;-... Until here!
    &lt;rest of derived code file ... &gt;

This changes the comment symbol the apostrophe,
making comments parseable by a BASIC (or other language.)</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.21">Use the @first directive_ in @thin trees or @nosent trees.
Use the @silent directive in @root trees.

The @first directive puts lines at the very start of files derived from @thin.
For example, the body text of @thin spam.py might be::

    @first #! /usr/bin/env python

The body text of @thin foo.pl might be::

    @first #/usr/bin/perl

Leo recognizes the @first directive_ only at the start of the body text of @thin nodes.
No text may precede @first directives_.
More than one @first directive may exist, like this::

    @first #! /usr/bin/env python
    @first # more comments.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.22">Leo has good support for `CWEB`_.
@thin trees can organize any part of CWEB code using *noweb* sections.
You can also use @asis or @nosent trees to create cweb files.
See `CWEB mode`_ for full details.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.24">No. Everything in an @thin trees must be part of the external file: orphan and
\@ignore nodes are invalid in @thin trees. This restriction should not be
troublesome. For example, you can organize your outline like this::

    + myClass
    ..+ ignored stuff
    ..+ @file myClass

(As usual, + denotes a headline.) So you simply create a new node_, called
myClass, that holds your @thin trees and stuff you don't want in the @thin
trees.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.25">By Rich Ries.
Some older C compilers don't understand the "//" comment symbol, so using @language C won't work.
Moreover, the following does not always work either::

    @comment /* */

This generates the following sentinel line::

    /*@@comment /* */*/

in the output file, and not all C compilers allow nested comments, so the last \*\/ generates an error.
The solution is to use::

    #if 0
    @comment /* */
    #endif

Leo is happy: it recognizes the @comment directive_.
The C compiler is happy: the C preprocessor strips out the offending line before the C
compiler gets it.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.5">Use @thin trees unless you are *sure* you must have the extra flexibility of @root trees.
Indeed, @thin trees are much easier to use than @root trees:

- @thin trees use less markup than @root trees.
  In particular, the @others directive is valid only within @thin trees.

- You must explicitly tangle_ and untangle_ @root trees using the `Tangle and Untangle`_ commands.

However, @root trees are more flexible than @thin trees:

- Sections_ may be defined anywhere within @root trees.
  Moreover, the @unit directive_ expands the scope of section definitions in @root trees
  so that a section may be referenced in several @root trees.

- The meaning of section definitions in @root trees are independent of their position within the tree.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.7">Use methods for any code that is used (called or referenced) more than once.

Sections_ are convenient in the following circumstances:

-   When you want to refer to snippets of code the can not be turned into methods.
    For example, many plugins start with the code like this::

    &lt;&lt; docstring &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; version history &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; globals &gt;&gt;

    None of these sections could be replaced by methods.

-   When you want to refer to a snippet of code that shares local variables with the enclosing code.
    This is surprisingly easy and safe to do, *provided* the section is used only in one place.
    `Section names`_ in such contexts can be clearer than method names.  For example::

    &lt;&lt; init ivars for writing &gt;&gt;

In short, I create sections when convenient,
and convert them to functions or methods if they need to be used in several places.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.74">The Import Files dialog allows you to select multiple files provided you are running Python 2.3 or above.
There is also an importFiles script in LeoPy.leo.  You can use that script as follows::

    import leo.core.leoImport as leoImport
    leoImport.importFiles(aDirectory, ".py")

This will import all .py files from aDirectory, which should be a full path to a particular directory.
You could use ".c" to import all .c files, etc.</t>

When building Tcl on Linux, do not specify "--enable-threads"
Only use Tcl with the default "threads not enabled" case.

Here is how to build Tk without thread support:

- Go to www.tcl.tk, and download the sources for Tcl and Tk.
- Build those two pack's as is told in the "How to Compile Tcl Source Releases"
- Go to www.python.org and download your favorite Python (2.3.5 for me).
- Build it as is told on the download page.
- Enjoy using Leo on Linux.

<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.77">Just `run Leo in a console window`_. At the point you want to drop into the
debugger, execute this line::

    g.pdb()

All output from pdb goes to stdout, which is the console window. It would be
good to create a subclass of pdb.Pdb that uses Leo's log pane rather than a
console window, but I haven't done that. It could be done easily enough in a
plugin...

**Important**: I recommend using g.trace instead of pdb.  For example::

    g.trace(x)

prints the name of the function or method containing the trace, and the value of
x. g.callers is often useful in combination with g.trace. g.callers(5)
returns the last 5 entries of the call stack. For example::

    g.trace(x,g.callers(5))

Used this way, g.trace shows you patterns that will be invisible using pdb.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.9">Internally, Leo represents all strings as unicode. Leo translates from a
particular encoding to Unicode_ when reading .leo files or external files. Leo
translates from Unicode_ to a particular encoding when writing external files.
You may see strange looking characters if your text editor is expecting a
different encoding. The encoding used in any external file is shown in the
#@+leo sentinel line like this::

    #@+leo-encoding=iso-8859-1.

**Exception**: the encoding is UTF-8 if no -encoding= field exists.
You can also use the @encoding directive_ to set the encoding for individual external files.
If no @encoding directive_ is in effect,
Leo uses the following settings_ to translate to and from unicode:

default_derived_file_encoding
    The encoding used for external files if no @encoding directive_ is in effect.
    This setting also controls the encoding of files created by the Tangle commands.
    The default is UTF-8 (case not important).

new_leo_file_encoding
    The encoding specified in the following line of new .leo files::

        &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"&gt;

    The default is UTF-8 (upper case for compatibility for old versions of Leo).

tk_encoding
    The encoding that Leo uses to communicate with Tk text widgets.
    You would typically use this setting only in an emergency.
    The section called::

        &lt;&lt; set app.tkEncoding &gt;&gt;

    in app.finishCreate sets this encoding as follows:

    a) using the tk_encoding setting if it exists,
    b) using locale.getpreferredencoding if it exists,
       or the equivalent code in pre-python 2.3 versions,
    c) using sys.getdefaultencoding
    d) defaulting to "utf-8"

    Neither b nor c are guaranteed to give a valid encoding in all systems,
    and Leo will ignore invalid encodings returned from b or c.
    Therefore, setting the tk_encoding setting may be needed.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050830120844">c.frame.menu.createMenuItemsFromTable will append items to the end of an existing menu.
For example, the following script will add a new item at the end of the 'File' menu::

    def callback(*args,**keys):
        g.trace()

    table = (("Test1",None,callback),)

    c.frame.menu.createMenuItemsFromTable('File',table)

Plugins can do anything that can be done with Tk using the menu returned by
c.frame.menu.getMenu. For example, here is a script that adds a Test menu item
after the 'Open With' menu item in the File menu::

    def callback(*args,**keys):
        g.trace()

    fileMenu = c.frame.menu.getMenu('File')

    # 3 is the position in the menu.  Other kinds of indices are possible.
    fileMenu.insert(3,'command',label='Test2',command=callback)</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830120857">The trick is to create a workflow that separates editing from testing. Putting
test code in LeoPy.leo would waste a lot of time. To run tests you would
have to exit Leo and reload LeoPy.leo. A much quicker way is to put all test
code in a test.leo file. So to change and test code, do the following:

1. Save LeoPy.leo but do **not** exit Leo. 

2. Quit the copy of Leo running test.leo, then reload test.leo.

3. Run test scripts from test.leo.

That's all. Python will recompile any changed .py files in the new copy of Leo.
**Note**: I create a batch file called t.bat that runs test.leo, so to the
"edit-reload-test" cycle is just:

1. Control-S (in LeoPy.leo: saves the .leo file)
2. t         (in a console window: runs test.leo, compiling all changed .py files as a side effect)
3. Control-E (in test.leo: runs the test script)

The benefits of the new workflow:

- test.leo loads  _much_ more quickly than LeoPy.leo does.
  This new approach can increase the speed of the edit-reload-test cycle by more than a factor of 10.
  Hitting Control-S, t, Control-E takes about 5 seconds.

- LeoPy.leo runs with the *old* code,
  so it is much easier to fix syntax errors or exceptions in the *new* code:
  just fix the problem and save LeoPy.leo *without* closing LeoPy.leo,
  then restart test.leo.
  You run your tests on the new code, but you edit the new code with the old, stable code.

- test.leo is the perfect place to develop test.
  I can create and organize those tests and when I am done, ''test.leo'' is a log of my work.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050901073048">**Important**: We often refer to outline_ nodes_ by the directives_ they contain.
For example, an `@root node`_ is a node containing an @root directive_, etc.
**Exception**: An `@file node`_ is a node whose *headline* starts with @file.

.. _`@auto node`:
.. _`@file node`:
.. _`@thin node`:
.. _`@root node`:
.. _`@file nodes`:
.. _`@thin nodes`:
.. _`@root nodes`:

@file node
    An @file node_ is a node whose *headline* starts with @file.
    **Important**: Headlines_ that start with @file-asis, @file-noref, @file-nosent
    (and their abbreviations @asis, @noref, @nosent) are collectively called @file nodes.

.. _`@thin tree`:
.. _`@root tree`:
.. _`@file trees`:
.. _`@shadow trees`:
.. _`@thin trees`:
.. _`@root trees`:

@file tree, @others tree, @root tree, etc.
    An @file tree_ is a tree whose root_ is an @file node, etc.

@asis, @auto, @file, @noref, @nosent, @thin
    Headlines_ that start with one of these create (correspond to) `external files`_.

        @nosent, @file-nosent

    For more information, see the documentation for `@asis`_, `@auto`_, `@file`_, `@noref`_, `@nosent`_ and `@thin`_
    in Leo's `programming reference`_ chapter.

    \@auto trees allow you to edit external files that contain no sentinels.
    Leo will import the @auto files when reading .leo files.  Be careful when first creating the @auto node.
    *Before* saving the .leo file containing the new @auto node,
    use the read-at-auto-nodes command to do the initial import.

    **Important**:
    Leo does not support `noweb's`_ @&lt;&lt; and @&gt;&gt; escape conventions.
    Any line containing matched &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; is a `section reference`_, regardless of context.
    To use &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; as ordinary characters, place them on separate lines.

    View nodes are typically ordinary, non-`cloned`_ nodes that contain cloned `descendant`_ nodes.
    The cloned descendant nodes comprise most of the data of the view.
    Other non-cloned nodes may add additional information to the view.
    See `clones &amp; views`_ in the `Leo's tutorial`_ for more information.

Weaving
    The process of creating typeset documentation from a noweb_ or CWEB_ source file.
    Weaving creates documentation. Tangling_ creates `external files`_.
    Leo does not support weaving directly.
    To weave a file you can create noweb_ or CWEB_ files using Leo's Export commands,
    then use the noweb_ or CWEB_ systems to weave those files.</t>

Chapter 11: White Papers
##########################

..  I wrote the first two white papers soon after discovering Python.
..  The conclusions in these papers have remained largely unchanged.
..  I wrote the third in November 2004, and rewrote it in February 2006.

I wrote this white paper soon after discovering Python in 2001.
The conclusions are still valid today.

<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.2">What struck me first as I converted C++ code to Python is how much less blah,
blah, blah there is in Python. No braces, no stupid semicolons and most
importantly, *no declarations*. No more pointless distinctions between
const, char \*, char const \*, char \* and wxString.
No more wondering whether a variable should be signed, unsigned, short or long.

Declarations add clutter, declarations are never obviously right and
declarations don't prevent memory allocation tragedies. Declarations also hinder
prototyping. In C++, if I change the type of something I must change all related
declarations; this can be a huge and dangerous task. With Python, I can change
the type of an object without changing the code at all! It's no accident that
Leo's new log pane was created first in Python.

Functions returning tuples are a "minor" feature with a huge impact on code
clarity. No more passing pointers to data, no more defining (and allocating and
deallocating) temporary structs to hold multiple values.

Python can't check declarations because there aren't any. However, there is a
really nifty tool called Pychecker that does many of the checks typically done
by compilers. See `pychecker`_ for details.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.3">Python is much more powerful than C++, not because Python has more features, but
because Python needs *less* features. Some examples:

-   Python does everything that the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) does,
    without any of the blah, blah, blah needed by STL.
    No fuss, no muss, no code bloat.

-   Python's slicing mechanism is very powerful and applies to any sequence (string, list or tuple).
    Python's string library does more with far less functions because slices replace many functions
    typically found in other string libraries.

-   Writing dict = {} creates a dictionary (hash table).
    Hash tables can contain anything, including lists and other hash tables.

-   Python's special functions,  __init__, __del__, __repr__, __cmp__, etc.
    are an elegant way to handle any special need that might arise.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.4">Before using Python I never fully realized how difficult and dangerous memory allocation is in C++.
Try doing::

        aList[i:j] = list(aString)

in C.  You will write about 20 lines of C code.
Any error in this code will create a memory allocation crash or leak.

Python is fundamentally safe. C++ is fundamentally unsafe. When I am using
Python I am free from worry and anxiety. When I am using C++ I must be
constantly "on guard." A momentary lapse can create a hard-to-find pointer bug.
With Python, almost nothing serious can ever go wrong, so I can work late at
night, or after a beer. The Python debugger is always available. If an exception
occurs, the debugger/interpreter tells me just what went wrong. I don't have to
plan a debugging strategy! Finally, Python recovers from exceptions, so Leo can
keep right on going even after a crash!</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.5">Python has almost all the speed of C. Other interpretive environments such as
icon and Smalltalk have clarity, power and safety similar to Python. What makes
Python unique is its seamless way of making C code look like Python code.
Python executes at essentially the speed of C code because most Python modules
are written in C. The overhead in calling such modules is negligible. Moreover,
if code is too slow, one can always create a C module to do the job.

In fact, Python encourages optimization by moving to higher levels of
expression. For example, Leo's Open command reads an XML file. If this command
is too slow I can use Python's XML parser module. This will speed up Leo while
at the same time raising the level of the code.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.6">Little of Python is completely new. What stands out is the superb engineering
judgment evident in Python's design. Python is extremely powerful, yet small,
simple and elegant. Python allows me to express my intentions clearly and at the
highest possible level.

The only hope of making Leo all it can be is to use the best possible tools. I
believe Python (possibly with Tkinter) will allow me to add, at long last, the
new features that Leo should have.

Edward K. Ream, October 25, 2001.  P.S., September, 2005:

Four years of experience have only added to my admiration for Python. Leo could
not possibly be what it is today without Python.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050901174937">You can run Leo from a Python interpreter as follows::

    import leo
    leo.run() # runs Leo, opening a new outline or,
    leo.run(fileName=aFileName) # runs Leo, opening the given file name.

Another way to run Leo is as follows::

    cd &lt;path-to-launchLeo.py&gt;
    python launchLeo.py %1

Here are some tips that may make running Leo easier:

**Linux**
    The following shell script will allow you to open foo.leo files by typing leo foo::

        #!/bin/sh 
        python &lt;leopath&gt;launchLeo.py $1

    where &lt;leopath&gt; is the path to the directory containing the leo directory. 

**Windows**
    If you have associated .leo files with Leo you may run Leo by double-clicking any .leo file.
    You can also use a batch file.
    Put the following .bat file in c:\\Windows::

        cd &lt;path-to-leo&gt;
        c:\python25\python &lt;path-to-leo&gt;launchLeo.py %1

    where &lt;path-to-leo&gt; is the path to the directory *containing* the leo directory.

    This opens the file specified by the first argument (%1).

The first time you start Leo, a dialog will ask you for a unique identifier. If
you are using cvs, use your cvs login name. Otherwise your initials will do. Leo
stores this identifier in the file .leoID.txt. Leo attempts to create
leoID.txt in the .leo sub-directory of your home directory, then in Leo's config directory, and
finally in Leo's core directory. You can change this identifier at any time by
editing .leoID.txt.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902073404">Scripts must wary of saving positions because positions become invalid
whenever the user moves, inserts or deletes nodes.  It is valid to store
positions **only** when a script knows that the stored position will be used
before the outline's stucture changes.

To store a postion, the script must use the p.copy() method::

    p2 = p.copy()   # Correct: p2 will not change when p changes later.

The following **will not work**::

    p2 = p  # Wrong.  p2 will change if p changes later.

For example, the following creates a dictionary of saved positions::

    d = {}
    for p in c.all_positions():
        d[p.v] = p.copy()
        
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902080416"># Start at the top.
b = c.frame.body.bodyCtrl
b.mark_set('insert','1.0')
b.tag_remove('sel','1.0','end')
b.tag_add('sel','1.0','1.0')
b.update_idletasks()

# Format until the end.
count = 0 # Guard against loops.
while count &lt; 100:
    count += 1
    s = p.bodyString()
    if not s.strip():
        break

<t tx="ekr.20050902100834">This following information may be of interest to historians. It is not of
general enough interest to put in Leo's Users Guide on the web. I am including
this mass of detail here to indicate the complexities that were involved in
designing Leo's simple-looking mechanisms.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852">Leo grew out of my efforts to use Donald Knuth's "CWEB system of Structured
documentation." I had known of literate programming since the mid 1980's, but I
never understood how to make it work for me. In November 1995 I started thinking
about literate programming in earnest. Over the holidays I mused about making
literate programs more understandable. In January 1996 the fog of confusion
suddenly cleared. I summarized my thinking with the phrase, **web are outlines
in disguise**. I suspected that outline views were the key to literate
programming, but many details remained obscure.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.1">March 5, 1996, is the most important date in Leo's history. While returning from
a day of skiing, I discussed my thoughts with Rebecca. During that conversation
I realized that I could use the MORE outliner as a prototype for a "literate
outliner." I immediately started work on my first literate outline. It quickly
became apparent that outlines work: all my old problems with literate
programming vanished. The @others directive dates from this day. I realized
that MORE's outlines could form the basis for Leo's screen design. Rather
than opening body text within the outline, as MORE does, I decided to use a
separate body pane.

I hacked a translator called M2C which allowed me to use MORE to write
real code. I would write code in MORE, copy the text to the clipboard in
MORE format, then run M2C, which would tangle the outline into C code.
This process was useful, if clumsy. I called the language used in the outline
SWEB, for simplified CWEB. Much later Leo started supporting the noweb
language.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.10">Leo first used gnx's (global node indices) as a foolproof way of associating
nodes in .leo files with nodes in external files. At the time, there was
still intense discussions about protecting the logical consistency of
outlines. @thin was later to solve all those problems, but nobody knew
that then.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.11">Leo 4.2 Final went out the door September 20, 2004.
This surely is one of the most significant dates in Leo's history:

-   This marked the end worries about consistency of outlines and external files:
    Leo recreates all essential information from thin external files,
    so *there is nothing left in the .leo file to get out of synch*.

- Thin external files use gnx's extensively. This simplifies the file format and
    makes thin external files more cvs friendly.

-   A sensational scripting plugin showed how to create script buttons.
    This has lead to improvements in the Execute Script command and
    other significant improvements in Unit testing.

-   As if this were not enough, 4.2 marked the 'great divide' in Leo's internal
    data structures. Before 4.2, Leo every node in the outline had its own
    vnode. This was a big performance problem: clone operations had to
    traverse the entire outline! 4.2 represents clones by sharing subtrees.
    Changing Leo's fundamental data structures while retaining compatibility
    with old scripts was engineering work of which the entire Leo community can
    be proud. `Chapter 7: Scripting Leo with Python`_ tells how the position
    class makes this happen.
    This was a cooperative effort. Kent Tenney and Bernhard Mulder made
    absolutely crucial contributions. Kent pointed out that it is a tnode,
    not a vnode that must form the root of the shared data. Bernhard showed
    that iterators are the way to avoid creating huge numbers of positions.

Leo 4.2 marked so many significant changes. I often find it hard to remember
what life with Leo was like before it.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.12">Leo 4.3 corrected many problems with leoConfig.txt. Instead, Leo gets
settings from one or more leoSettings.leo files. This version also
introduced a way to changed settings using a settings dialog.  However,
the settings dialog proved not to be useful (worse, it inhibited design) and
the settings dialog was retired in Leo 4.4.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.2">Throughout 1996 I created a version of Leo on the Macintosh in plain C and the
native Mac Toolbox. This was a poor choice; I wasted a huge amount of time
programming with these primitive tools. However, this effort convinced me that
Leo was a great way to program.

Late in 1997 I wrote a Print command to typeset an outline. Printing (Weaving)
is supposedly a key feature of literate programming. Imagine my surprise when I
realized that such a "beautiful" program listing was almost unintelligible; all
the structure inherent in the outline was lost! I saw clearly that typesetting,
no matter how well done, is no substitute for explicit structure.

In 1998 I created a version of Leo using Apple's YellowBox environment. Alas,
Apple broke its promises to Apple developers. I had to start again.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.3">I rewrote Leo for Borland C++ starting in May 1999. Borland C++ was much better
than CodeWarrior C, but it was still C++. This version of Leo was the first
version to use xml as the format of .leo files. The last version of Borland Leo,
3.12 Final went out the door July 17, 2003.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.4">I attended the Python conference in early 2001. In May of 2000 I began work on
an wxWindows version of Leo. This did not work out, but something good did come
from this effort. I spent a lot of time adding Python scripting to the wxWindows
code and I became familiar with Python and its internals.

I really started to 'get' Python in September 2001. I wrote the white papers at
about this time. Python solved *all* my programming problems. I rewrote Leo in
Python in about two months! For the first time in my career I was no longer
anxious while programming; it simply isn't possible to create bad bugs in
Python. The Python version of Leo was the first officially OpenSoftware version of
Leo. The first functional version of Leo in Python was 0.05 alpha, December 17,
2001.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.5">I registered the Leo project on SourceForge on March 10, 2003. It is certainly
no accident that Leo started a new life shortly thereafter. Prior to SourceForge
my interest in Leo had been waning.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.6">In the summer of 2001 I began to consider using sentinel lines in external files.
Previously I had thought that outline structure must be 'protected' by remaining
inside .leo files. Accepting the possibility that sentinels might be corrupted
opened vast new design possibilities. In retrospect, problems with sentinel
almost never happen, but that wasn't obvious at the time! The result of this
design was known at first as Leo2. That terminology is extinct. I think of
this version as the first version to support @file and automatic tangling
and untangling.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.7">The biggest surprise in Leo's history was the realization it is **much** easier
to untangle files derived from @file. Indeed, @root creates all sorts of
problems that just disappear when using @file. The new Python version of Leo
became fully operational in early 2002. It was probably about this time that I chose
noweb as Leo's preferred markup language. My decision not to support noweb's
escape sequences made Leo's read code much more robust.

<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.8">I spent 2002 taking advantages of Python's tremendous power and safety.
Many improvements were at last easy enough to do:

- Nested @others directives appeared in 3.2.
- Unicode support started in 3.3.
- @first and @last appeared in 3.7
- @asis and @nosent appeared in 3.8.
- Incremental syntax coloring and incremental undo appeared in 3.9.
- Paul Paterson created Leo's plugin architecture sometime during this period.
  Plugins have been a driving force in Leo's development because people can
  change how Leo works without altering Leo's core.
- 3.12 fixed a huge memory leak.
- 3.12 Final, the last 3.x version, appeared July 17, 2003.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.9">In late 2002 and throughout 2003 I worked on an entirely new file format.
4.0 final went out the door October 17, 2003 after almost a year intense
design work trying to improve error recovery scheme used while reading
external files. In the summer of 2003 I realized that orphan and @ignore'd
nodes must be prohibited in @file trees. With this restriction, Leo
could finally recreate @file trees in outlines using **only** the
information in external files. This made the read code much more robust, and
eliminated all the previous unworkable error recovery schemes. At last Leo
was on a completely firm foundation.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902160924">**Important**: Script buttons are easier to use than the script-oriented
find/change commands described next. I recommend using script buttons whenever
possible. See `Creating script buttons`_.
You are not likely to need all the firepower that script-orient find/change commands,
but it could save you lots of time for complex jobs.

Leo's find panel contains the Script Search radio button and the Script
Change checkbox. When the Script Search radio button is selected Leo treats the
contents of the Search Text as a script to execute whenever any kind of Find
command is executed. Similarly, when the Script Change checkbox is selected Leo
treats the context of the Change Text as a script to execute whenever any kind
of Change command is executed.

Script-based find-change turns Leo's Find/Change panel into a platform for
running scripts interactively. The script writer need not write code to control
interactive searches.

Here's how it works. Leo dedicates g.app.searchDict for
communication between Leo and the search and change scripts. The search and
change scripts may also use g.app.searchDict for communication between themselves.
Leo sets g.app.searchDict["type"] to "find", "change", "findAll" or "changeAll" to
indicate the kind of command being executed. Scripts may use all other entries
in g.app.searchDict as they please.

Here is what Leo does when the user presses buttons with Script Search enable:

Find and Change, then Find buttons
    Leo executes the find script once. Typically, the find script would traverse
    the tree and highlight the found text or otherwise indicate to the user that
    the find operation has succeeded. However, the script can do anything it
    pleases.

Find All button
    Leo executes the find script repeatedly until g.app.searchDict["continue"] evaluates
    to False. Initially there is no entry for g.app.searchDict["continue"], so the
    find script must set g.app.searchDict["continue"] = True if it wants Leo call it again.

Change button
    Leo executes the change script once. Typically, the change script would change
    the selected text. Usually the change script will compute the new value of body
    text and call c.setBodyString(p,newText) to make that change permanent. 
    To handle undo, the change script can call
    c.frame.onBodyChanged(v,"Change",oldText=oldText).

Change All button
    Leo executes the change script repeatedly
    until g.app.searchDict["continue"] evaluates to false.

Most find and change scripts will ignore settings in the Find Panel like "whole
word", "pattern match", and "reverse". However, these settings are available to
the scripts via ivars such as c.whole_word_flag, etc. if desired.

The initScriptFind script in LeoPy.leo makes it easy to set up script based searches:

1. Put the following code in the root of a tree that will contain your script search::

    # Initialize Leo's find panel using the named children of this node.
    import leo.core.leoGlobals as g.
    g.initScriptFind("Find script","Change script") # Second argument is optional.
    # Start searching at the top.
    c.selectPosition(c.rootPosition())

2. Put the search script in a child node called "Find script" (no quotes).

3. (Optional) Put the change script in a child node called "Change script"

4.  Execute the code above.  Leo does the following:

- Puts the body of the "Find script" into the find text of Leo's Find/Change dialog.
- Puts the body of the "Change script" into the change text of Leo's Find/Change dialog.
- Selects the Script Find radio button.
- Selects the Script Change checkbox if the change script exists.
- Selects the root of the entire outline.

Presto! Leo is ready for a script search. **Note**: you could also consider creating a
script button to set up complex find/change scripts.

Here are some ideas for using script find/change.

-   Find and change scripts may use Python's re module.  For
    example, the find script could set g.app.searchDict["m"] to the match object
    returned by re's match method.  The change script would then compute the
    result, change the text and set the undo info as usual.

-   Find and change scripts may operate on data outside any Leo outline.
    For example, script-find scripts could traverse your file system.
    Scripts could even pull data from the file system
    into the outline so that you can see the effects of changes as the scripts
    operate.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050903074833">Plugins and other scripts can register event handlers (also known as hooks) with code such as::

    leoPlugins.registerHandler("after-create-leo-frame",onCreate)
    leoPlugins.registerHandler("idle", on_idle) 
    leoPlugins.registerHandler(("start2","open2","command2"), create_open_with_menu) 

As shown above, a plugin may register one or more event handlers with a single call to
leoPlugins.registerHandler. Once a hook is registered, Leo will call the
registered function' at the named **hook time**. For example::

    leoPlugins.registerHandler("idle", on_idle)

causes Leo to call on_idle at "idle" time.

Event handlers must have the following signature::

    def myHook (tag, keywords):
        whatever

-   tag is the name of the hook (a string).
-   keywords is a Python dictionary containing additional information.
    The following section describes the contents of the keywords dictionary in detail.

**Important**: hooks should get the proper commander this way::

    c = keywords.get('c')</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050903074833.1">The following table tells about each event handler: its name, when it is called,
and the additional arguments passed to the hook in the keywords dictionary.
For some kind of hooks, Leo will skip its own normal processing if the hook
returns anything *other* than None. The table indicates such hooks with 'yes' in
the 'Stop?' column.

**Important**: Ever since Leo 4.2, the v, old_v and new_v keys in
the keyword dictionary contain *positions*, not vnodes. These keys are
deprecated. The new_c key is also deprecated. Plugins should use the c key instead.

============================= ======== =================================== =============================

**Notes**:

1.  'activate' and 'deactivate' hooks have been removed because they do not work as expected.

2.  'commands' hooks: The label entry in the keywords dict contains the
    'canonicalized' form of the command, that is, the lowercase name of the command
    with all non-alphabetic characters removed.
    Commands hooks now set the label for undo and redo commands 'undo' and 'redo'
    rather than 'cantundo' and 'cantredo'.

3.  'menu1' hook: Setting g.app.realMenuNameDict in this hook is an easy way of
    translating menu names to other languages. **Note**: the 'new' names created this
    way affect only the actual spelling of the menu items, they do *not* affect how
    you specify shortcuts settings, nor do they affect the 'official'
    command names passed in g.app.commandName. For example::

        app().realMenuNameDict['Open...'] = 'Ouvre'.

4.  'open1' and 'open2' hooks: These are called with a keywords dict containing the following entries:

    - c:          The commander of the newly opened window.
    - old_c:      The commander of the previously open window.
    - new_c:      (deprecated: use 'c' instead) The commander of the newly opened window.
    - fileName:   The name of the file being opened.

    You can use old_c.p and c.p to get the current position in the old and new windows.
    Leo calls the 'open1' and 'open2' hooks only if the file is not already open. Leo
    will also call the 'open1' and 'open2' hooks if: a) a file is opened using the
    Recent Files menu and b) the file is not already open.

5.  '\@url1' and '\@url2' hooks are only executed if the 'icondclick1' hook returns None.

6.  These hooks are useful for testing.

7.  These hooks allow plugins to parse and handle markup within doc parts,
    comments and Python ''' strings. Note that these hooks are *not* called in
    Python ''' strings. See the color_markup plugin for a complete example of how to
    use these hooks.

8.  Leo calls the 'create-optional-menus' hook when creating menus. This hook need
    only create new menus in the correct order, without worrying about the placement
    of the menus in the menu bar. See the plugins_menu and scripts_menu plugins for
    examples of how to use this hook.

9.  The New command calls 'new'.
    The 'new_c' key is deprecated.  Use the 'c' key instead.

10. g.scanDirectives calls 'scan-directives' hook.
    g.scanDirectives returns a dictionary, say d.
    d.get('pluginsList') is an a list of tuples (d,v,s,k) where:

    - d is the spelling of the @directive, without the leading @.
    - v is the vnode containing the directive, _not_ the original vnode.
    - s[k:] is a string containing whatever follows the @directive.
      k has already been moved past any whitespace that follows the @directive.

    See the add_directives plugins directive for a complete example of how to use
    the 'scan-directives' hook.

11. g.app.closeLeoWindow calls the 'close-frame' hook just before
    removing the window from g.app.windowList. The hook code may remove the window
    from app.windowList to prevent g.app.closeLeoWindow from destroying the window.

12. g.app.destroyAllGlobalWindows calls the 'destroy-all-global-windows' hook.
    This hook gives plugins the chance to clean up after themselves when Leo shuts down.

13. Leo calls the 'headkey1' and 'headkey2' when the headline *might* have changed.

14. p is the new node (position) containing '@auto filename.ext'</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050903075144">A **plugin** is a Python file that appears in Leo's plugin directory. Plugins
modify how Leo works. With plugins you can give Leo new commands, modify how
existing commands work, or change any other aspect of Leo's look and feel.
leoPlugins.leo contains all of Leo's official plugins. Studying this file is
a good way to learn how to write plugins.

You **enable** plugins using @enabled-plugins nodes in leoSettings.leo or
myLeoSettings.leo. For more details, see the @enabled-plugins node in
leoSettings.leo. Leo imports all enabled plugins at startup time. Plugins become
**active** if importing the plugin was successful.

Writing plugins is quite similar to writing any other Leo script.  See
`Chapter 7\: Scripting Leo with Python`_. In particular:

1. Plugins can use any of Leo's source code simply by importing any module
   defined in leoPy.leo.

2. Plugins can register event handlers just like any other Leo script. For full
   details, see the section called `event handlers`_ in Leo's scripting chapter.

The rest of this chapters discusses topics related specifically to plugins.

<t tx="ekr.20050903161843">Creating a script button should be your first thought whenever you want to
automate any task. The scripting plugin, mod_scripting.py, puts two buttons
in the icon menu, a pink Run Script button and a yellow Script Button
button. The Run Script button does the same thing as the Execute Script
command. The Script Button button is the interesting one. It creates a
button, confusingly called a **script button** in the icon area. A script button
executes a script when you push it.

Suppose node N is selected. When you press the Script Button button a new
(pink) script button is created. The name of the new button is N's headline
text. The script associated with the new button is N's body text. Now whenever
you press the new button, N's script is executed on the **presently** selected
node. Script buttons are extraordinarily useful. In effect, each script button
defines an instant command! For example, sometimes my fingers get tired of
saving a file. I simply put Save in a node's headline and c.save() in
the body text. I hit the Script Button button and I get a new button called
Save that will save the outline when I press it.

Here's a more interesting example. The following script searches the present node
and its ancestors looking for an @rst node. When such a node is found the
script calls the `rst3 plugin`_ to format it. I don't have to select the actual
@rst node; I can select any of its children::

    import leo.core.leoPlugins as leoPlugins
    rst3 = leoPlugins.getPluginModule('rst3')
    if rst3: # already loaded.
        controller = rst3.controllers.get(c)
        if controller:
            for p in p.self_and_parents():
                if p.h.startswith('@rst '):
                    controller.processTree(p)
                    break
    else: # Just load the plugin.
        rst3 = leoPlugins.loadOnePlugin('rst3',verbose=True)
        if rst3:
            g.es('rst3 loaded')
            rst3.onCreate('tag',{'c':c})
        else:
            # Ask to be removed.
            g.app.scriptDict['removeMe'] = True

**Notes**:

-   The scripting plugin pre-defines the c, g and p symbols
    just as the Execute Script command does.

-   By default a script button executes the **present** body text of the node that original created the script button.
    This is very handy: you can modify a script button's script at any time without having to recreate the script button.

-   You can delete any script button by right-clicking on it.

-   On startup, the scripting plugin scans the entire .leo file and creates a script button
    for every node whose headline starts with @button scriptName.
    **Warning**: this is indeed a security risk of the kind discussed later.
    This feature can be disabled by setting atButtonNodes = True at the start of mod_scripting.py.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050906090012">Leo (and other programs) often send more detailed error messages to stderr,
the output stream that goes to the console window. In Linux and MacOS
environments, python programs normally execute with the console window visible.
On Windows, can run Leo with the console window visible by associating .leo
files with python.exe *not* pythonw.exe.

<t tx="ekr.20050906104918">Leo 4.3.2 beta 1                  September 10, 2005

To learn about Leo, see: http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of 4.3.2:
-----------------------

- Improved Leo's documentation:
    - A tutorial introduction to Leo:
      http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html
    - A 5-minute guide to programming with Leo:
      http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html#quick-start-for-programmers

- The new rst3 plugin creates .html and .tex files from reStructuredText
  embedded in Leo files. Any node of the source outline may contain options for
  the rst3 plugin, which makes this plugin much more useful and flexible than
  the previous rst plugins. All of Leo's documentation was created using this
  plugin from sources in LeoDocs.leo. For full documentation for rst3 see:
  http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/rstplugin3.html.

- The spellpyx (spell checking) plugin is now much easier to use.

- The vim and openWith plugins now use Python's subprocess module if it is present.
 
- Improved the Pretty Printing command.

- The usual assortment of bug fixes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050906104918.1">Here is a summary of the changes:

- General: All chapters created with rst3 plugin. This ensures a uniform look.
The source is in LeoDocs.leo. Removed all references to older versions of Leo,
except when discussing old file formats in the Appendices. Corrected all text so
it discusses present version.

- rst3 plugin itself: Correct bug that caused chapters to be formatted
differently when processing multiple @rst trees.

- rst3 button in LeoDocs.leo: The script first looks *up* the tree, looking for
an @rst node. If found, it processes just that tree. If not found, it processes
all @rst nodes *below* the originally selected node. The button is now much more
convenient to use.

- Preface: Shorter, no history. No longer a dead end.

- What People are Saying About Leo: No longer a dead end.

- FAQ: Reorganized, simplified, revised. Added entries for running Leo in a
console window and debugging docutils. Improved entry for using cvs.

- Chapter 1: Installation: Now the first chapter. Revised.

- Chapter 2: Tutorial: Completely rewritten. Like Python's tutorial, this
chapter contains everything a beginner needs to understand and use Leo. The
`Quickstart for programmers` section is the heart of this chapter. All terms
used have links either to their definition in the tutorial or in the Glossary.
Newbies should be able to digest this chapter easily. This chapter should make
Leo comprehensible to many more people.

- Chapter 3: Using Outlines: Revised per general remarks above.

- Chapter 4: Writing Programs in Leo. Completely rewritten. The old chapter was
an embarrassment. The new chapter is a reference guide, properly organized as
such. The introduction warns newbies away.

- Chapter 5: Using Leo's Commands. 'Minor' revisions and corrections create a
substantially better result.

- Chapter 6: Leo and literate programming: Reformatting helps. New words about
rST markup and other improvements over traditional LP.

- Chapter 7: Scripting Leo with Python: Rewritten, simplified, updated and
corrected. The sources in LeoDocs.leo are directly executable. rST sources use
literal blocks instead of code-blocks so that the sources are simplified.
(Important when executing examples). Properly discusses positions, including
'supremely important' section on copying positions.

- Chapter 8: Customizing Leo. Heavily revised. Discusses leoSettings.leo, not
leoConfig.txt. Security warnings are more reasonable. Section on script buttons.
Rewrote section on uA's (Adding extensible attributes to nodes and .leo files).

- Chapter 9: History of Leo. Rewritten. Much shorter and more useful. Discusses
the major milestones, concentrating on explaining the major differences between
versions. Gone are details of how discoveries came to be. They are in
LeoPostings.leo, which will be included in the distribution.

- Chapter 10: Theory of Operation. Largely rewritten. Discusses positions
properly. Omits discussion of how clones were implemented before 4.2.

- Chapter 11: White Papers. A new chapter. This is a slightly-edited version of
writing that had been buried in the appendices.

- Appendices. Heavily revised and reformatted. Rewrote sections on file formats.

- Glossary: A separate chapter. All terms have links to their definition. All
definitions are rST targets so other chapters may refer to them. Added several
new entries.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050906104931.1"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20050906104931.15">http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3218558</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050906104931.38">The fix was to add an entry of 'unknown' state to state_dict. This fixes the
crash by brute force, but may not be strictly correct. However, this is pretty
much moot: we shall soon be moving to the new colorizer.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050906104931.42">The code gets c = keywords.get('c') in several places.
The protection is to return if c is None.
This affects the following files: plugins_menu.py, pluginsTest.py, plugin_manager.py</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050906104931.43">http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3231597

test.leo had some non-@ignore'd @thin nodes for files not in the distribution.

- Only files used by unit tests should be on cvs and the distribution.
    - test\unittest\batchTest.py and test\unittest\errorTest.py were already on cvs.
    - Added these files to the distribution.

- Other test files should be distributed in @ignore nodes.

- Leo's distribution checklist now has an item to check that the distributed test.leo can be opened without errors.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050906104931.48"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20050906104931.49">Calling print directly is dangerous: it will fail for unicode characters.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050906104931.56">The new Pretty Print code has the following improvements:

- Strip trailing blanks in get.
- Many improvement to doOp.
- Improved DoMultiline:
    - Added special case logic to ensure '#' is preceded by space except at start of line.
    - Added blank after multi-line string if needed.
- Added lastName token for special-case handling depending on previous token.
- No change to put, putArray or doName.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050907094633">Any .leo file may contain an @settings tree, so settings may be different for each commander.
Plugins and other scripts can get the value of settings as follows::

    format_headlines = c.config.getBool('rst3_format_headlines')
    print('format_headlines',format_headlines)

The c.config class has the following getters.
See the configSettings in leoCommands.py for details::

    c.config.getBool(settingName,default=None)
    c.config.getColor(settingName)
    c.config.getDirectory(settingName)
    c.config.getFloat(settingName)
    c.config.getInt(settingName)
    c.config.getLanguage(settingName)
    c.config.getRatio(settingName)
    c.config.getShortcut(settingName)
    c.config.getString(settingName)

These methods return None if no setting exists.
The getBool 'default' argument to getBool gives the value to be returned if the setting does not exist.

You can set any *existing* item in an @settings tree with c.config.set(p,setting,val).
For example::

    for val in (False,True):
        c.config.set(p,'rst3_format_headlines',val)
        format_headlines = c.config.getBool('rst3_format_headlines')
        print('format_headlines',format_headlines)

c.config.set does not change the @settings tree; it simply changes the values returned by the getters.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050908113904">This is a known bug in Tk that prevents this on Windows. The obvious Tk code
causes a hard crash in the Python dll: it's the only time Leo has taken such a
hard crash. The UniversalScrolling plugin is an attempt at a workaround.

Scrolling with the mouse wheel may be possible on Linux. See the code in
createTkTreeCanvas in leoTkinterFrame.py
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050908164150"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20050908164150.1">See http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/rstplugin3.html for full documentation
of this plugin.

The rst3 plugin creates output files from Leo outlines containing
reStructuredText (rST) ReStructuredText is a simple and powerful text formatting
markup language. Outlines are a natural way to organize rST (or any text).

This plugin adds the Write Restructured Text command to Leo's Edit menu. The
Write Restructured Text command searches the selected outline looking for rst
root nodes whose headline have the form @rst &lt;filename&gt;. The plugin then creates
the named file in various ways depending which rst3 options are in effect.

By default, the rst3 plugin creates rST headings automatically from outlines, so
the higher-level nodes in the outline correspond to higher-level sections in the
output. Creating rST headings automatically relieves you from one of the most
tedious chores in creating rST markup.

To use this plugin effectively, Python's docutils module must be installed. The
rst3 plugin will use the SilverCity syntax coloring package if it installed.

This plugin sends .htm, .html or .tex files to the docutils module for further
processing. Docutils generates HTML files or LaTeX files depending on the file's
extension. HTML files generated by docutils refer to three .css (cascading style
sheet) files that should exist in the same directory as the generated HTML file.
You can control the formatting of the HTML file by altering these .css files.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050908164150.2">This plugin now allows quotes within words, but strips quotes and other cruft
from the beginning and end of words. As a result, using the spellpyx spell
checker is much easier than before.

Leo's extensions folder now contains aspell23.pyd and aspell24.pyd. These are
Python dll's compiled for Python 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. You must rename one
of these files to be aspell.pyd and move aspell.pyd to the aspell folder. For
more details, see the installation nodes in the docstring for the spellpyx
plugin.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050909082711">- Fixed bug with non-unicode characters in file name

    http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3224635
    
    Leo crashed try to read .leo files whose name contained non-ascii characters.

- Fixed bug with non-unicode characters in settings value

    http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3222750
    
    Leo crashed try to write settings whose values contained non-ascii characters.

- Fixed bug tangling sections with non-unicode characters.

    http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3307318</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050910143326">These plugins now use Python's subprocess module if it is present. The
subprocess module comes standard with Python 2.4. For Linux systems, Leo will
use subprocess.py in Leo's extensions folder if necessary.

For Windows systems you can install Python's subprocess module in Python 2.2 or
2.3 as follows:
    
    - Go to http://www.effbot.org/downloads/#subprocess

    - Download and execute one of the following installers, depending on your version of Python:
        subprocess-0.1-20041012.win32-py2.3.exe 
        subprocess-0.1-20041012.win32-py2.2.exe
        
This installer installs the subprocess sources and also _subprocess.pyd in Python's site-packages folder.

This chapter discusses the plugins contained in leoPlugins.leo.
These plugins are part of Leo's official distribution.
`Chapter 13: Writing Plugins`_ tells how to write plugins.

The scripting plugin (mod_scripting.py) deserves special mention. This
plugin lets you create **script buttons** in a matter of seconds. See `Creating
script buttons`_. Script buttons are extraordinarily useful. Try them, you'll be
instantly hooked.

<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.1008">Automatically add nodes for common tasks.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.1041">Add Hoist/De-Hoist buttons to the toolbar.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.1050">Adds "Recent" and "Marks" pulldown buttons to the toolbar.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.1072">Adds a quick search to Leo's toolbar, along with a "GO" button to do quick
searches right from the main Leo window. All the current search options are
retained except that "search body text" is explicitly set - mainly because this
is by far the most common use case. Pressing &lt;CR&gt; while editing the text
automatically does a search. Repeated searches can be done by clicking the "GO"
button. The combo box also stores a list of previous searches, which can be
selected to quickly repeat a search. When activating a previous search the
original search mode is used.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.1092">This plugin supports Uniform Node Locators (UNL's). UNL's specify nodes within
Leo files. UNL's are not limited to nodes within the present Leo file; you can
use them to create cross-Leo-file links. This plugin consists of two parts:

1) Selecting a node shows the UNL in the status line at the bottom of the Leo
   window. You can copy from the status line and paste it into headlines, emails,
   whatever. 

2) Double-clicking @url nodes containing UNL's select the node specified in the
   UNL. If the UNL species in another Leo file, the other file will be opened.

UNL's referring to nodes within the present outline have the form::

    headline1--&gt;headline2--&gt;...--&gt;headlineN

where headline1 is the headline of a top-level node, and each successive headline is
the headline of a child node.  UNL's of the form::

    file:&lt;path&gt;#headline1--&gt;...--&gt;headlineN

refer to a node specified in &lt;path&gt; For example, double clicking the following
headline will take you to Chapter 8 of Leo's Users Guide::

    @url file:c:/prog/leoCvs/leo/doc/leoDocs.leo#Users Guide--&gt;Chapter 8: Customizing Leo

For example, suppose you want to email someone with comments about a Leo file.
Create a comments.leo file containing @url UNL nodes. That is, headlines are
@url followed by a UNL. The body text contains your comments about the nodes in
the _other_ Leo file! Send the comments.leo to your friend, who can use the
comments.leo file to quickly navigate to the various nodes you are talking
about. As another example, you can copy UNL's into emails. The recipient can
navigate to the nodes 'by hand' by following the arrows in the UNL.

**Notes**:

- At present, UNL's refer to nodes by their position in the outline. Moving a
  node will break the link.

- Don't refer to nodes that contain UNL's in the headline. Instead, refer to the
  parent or child of such nodes.

- You don't have to replace spaces in URL's or UNL's by '%20'.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.1105"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.113">Leo plugin that permits the definition of actions for double-clicking on file
nodes. Double-clicking in a @file node writes out the file if changes have
been made since the last save, and then runs a script on it, which is retrieved
from the outline. Scripts are located in a node whose headline is FileActions.
This node can be anywhere in the outline. If there is more than one such node,
the first one in outline order is used. The children of that node are expected
to contain a file pattern in the headline and the script to be executed in the
body. The file name is matched against the patterns (which are Unix-style shell
patterns), and the first matching node is selected. If the filename is a path,
only the last item is matched. Execution of the scripts is similar to the
Execute Script command in Leo. The main difference is that the namespace in
which the scripts are run contains two elements:

-   filename, which contains the filename from the @file directive.

-   shellScriptInWindow, a utility function that runs
    a shell script in an external windows, thus permitting
    programs to be called that require user interaction

File actions are implemented for @file nodes and all its variants
(@file-nosent, @thin, etc.). There is also a new node type
@file-ref for referring to files purely for the purpose of
file actions, Leo does not do anything with or to such files.</t>

archetype, node types or some arbitrary criteria. The annotations and colour
coding can play a similar role like that of syntax highlighting. Right-click on
the icon area to popup its menu to play with it.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.1187">A plugin to leave footprints! This colors the Leo nodes so that the ones you
have visited most and most recently will stand out.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.1285">A plugin that lets the user to associate text with a specific node.
Summon it by pressing button-2 or button-3 on an icon Box in the outline. This
will create an attribute editor where the user can add, remove and edit
attributes. Since attributes use the underlying tnode, clones will share the
attributes of one another.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.129">A Leo Plugin that adds Group commands functionality.  Restrictions currently apply to using Leo with a Tk front end.
There are several commands in this plugin:

-   Mark Node: marks a node for further operations such as copying, cloning and moving.

-   Mark Spot: marks a node as the place where group operations are to target.

-   Operate On Marked: moves lassoed nodes to the spot where the roundup node is
    placed. Clones are maintained.

-   Clear Marked: unmarks all marked nodes and removes the roundup node.

-   Transfer Lassoed Nodes: this is a menu for inter-window communication.
    The windows must all be spawned from the same Leo instance. 
    It allows the user to move all node marked for copying and moving from another window to this one.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.1299">Maximizes all new windows.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.1301">The nodebar plugin adds buttons at the bottom of the tree canvas. The buttons
correspond to commands found in the Outline commands. It is intended to speed up
a new users ability to use the outline. Experienced users may find value in
being able to quickly execute commands they do not use very often.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.1316">Send all output to the log pane.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.1317">Turns the log into a tabbed component.  Other plugins may add tabs.
To get a new tab in TabbedLog::

    import TabbedLog
    pane = TabbedLog.getPane(name,c)

- pane is the pane returned for you to work with.
- name is the name of the tab you want for the pane.
- c is the commander for the leoFrame.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.1323">A plugin for searching unknownAttributes (uA's).</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.1333">A plugin that enables the user to scroll down with a left mouse click and hold,
and to scroll up with a right mouse click and hold. Scrolling continues until
the user releases the mouse. Originally designed as a workaround for various
bugs in Tkinter scrolling, this may actually be superior to wheel scrolling, in
that there is little work a user has to do to scroll except to press a button.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.1342">This plugin uses Python's urllib module to download files and import them into Leo.
It requires the TabbedLog plugin.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.164">Creates new nodes containing parameterized section references.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.172">This plugin allows Leo to read a complete directory's outline into a Leo's
Outline. Directories are converted into headlines and files names are listed
into the bodies.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.184">Timestamp all save operations to show when they occur.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.186">Modify the way exported outlines are displayed.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.188">A plugin that helps customize pretty printing. It creates a do-nothing subclass
of the default pretty printer. To customize, simply override in this file the
methods of the base prettyPrinter class in leoCommands.py. You would typically
want to override putNormalToken or its allies. Templates for these methods have
been provided. You may, however, override any methods you like. You could even
define your own class entirely, provided you implement the prettyPrintNode
method.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.204">A plugin to schedule commands for later execution. It's provides the ability to
issue commands at a future time and to write messages that will be displayed at
a later time. To record commands You goto Schedule and choose begin recording.
Then you jump to the nodes and select the commands you want issued on them. This
process is ended with the end recording option. A dialog pops up. You can then
click on the individual commands and set the time for execution. To set the

<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.225">This plugin lets you add customizable templates to an outline. Templates are
like any other node except that the plugin replaces %s in the body text by
values that you specify when using template. Templates may have section
references; this plugin uses Leo's @nosent write machinery to create one
string out of possibly many nodes. This plugin requires the simplified atFile
write code that is new in 4.2.1.

This plugin creates two buttons in Leo's icon area:

- The '%s' button marks or unmarks a node as a template. A %s symbol will appear to
  the left of the node when it is marked as a template.

- The '----&gt; %s' button brings up a dialog that shows you the template text and
  asks you to specify the value for all %s instances. Dismissing this dialog
  inserts the template as the first child of the node, and creates a section
  reference in the node that references the template.

If a template does not have a '%s' in it, then the templates plugin just adds
the text as a node. Templates once marked are stored across sessions. Do not put
a template in a thin file, as your template mark will be erased between
sessions.

<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.2726">This plugin creates menu items in the File:Open With menu.

@openwith nodes in @settings trees create menu items. The openWith
plugin must be active for these settings to have any effect.

The headline of an @openwith node has the form::

    @openwith name = shortcut

name is name of the menu item. shortcut specifies the shortcut used to invoke
the menu item. shortcut may be None.

The body text @openwith nodes should contain a single line contain a tuple of the form::

    command,arg,ext

For example::

    'subprocess.Popen',['pythonw','C:/Python24/Lib/idlelib/idle.pyw'],'.py'

When the user selects this menu item Leo executes command(arg+path) where path
is the full path to the temp file. The ext argument specifies the extension of
the temp file.

Notes:

- command is a string.  Valid values are::

  'subprocess.Popen'
  'os.system'
  'os.startfile'
  'os.spawnl'
  'os.spawnv'
  'exec'

- arg is either a single string or a list of strings.

- ext is a string or None. If None, Leo computes a file extension base on what
  @language directive is in effect.

- If the .leo file being loaded contains @openwith nodes, the File:Open With
  menu contains only the items created by those nodes. Similarly, @openwith
  nodes in myLeoSettings.leo override entries in leoSettings.leo.

- If no @openwith nodes are found anywhere the openWith plugin uses hard-coded
  tables in the plugin itself.</t>

anydbm file: it's whatever the anydbm module uses.
Under Outline, there is an option called Library. This will open a
dialog with a list of the trees that you have saved. You can insert trees stored
in the library, remove them and add trees to the library. Be aware of unicode,
any characters outside of the ascii set gets turned into a ?. I found this
problem in storing some trees from Edward's Leo outline. Id like it to be able to
store unicode, but that may require a more specific db background, than anydbm.
Also note, that your library files may not be OS independent. If your python
distribution does not have the backing db on another machine, it will not be
able to open your library.
This should help people develop templates that they want to reuse between Leo

<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.2768">Multipath enables the ability to write a file to multiple locations. It acts as
a post-write mechanism, a file must be written to the file system for it to work.
At this point it is not a replacement for @path or an absolute path, it works in
tandem with them. To use, place @multipath at the start of a line in the root
node or an ancestor of the node. The format is (On Unix systems)::

    @multipath /machine/unit/:/machine/robot/:/machine/

It will place a copy of the written file in each of these directories.

There is an additional directive that simplifies common paths, it is called
@multiprefix. By typing @multiprefix with a path following it, before a
@multipath directive you set the beginning of the paths in the
@multipath directive. For example::

    @multiprefix /leo #@multipath /plugins 

or::

    @multiprefix /leo/
    @multipath plugins: fungus : drain

copies a file to /leo/plugins /leo/fungus /leo/drain.

The @multiprefix stays in effect for the entire tree until reset with
another @multiprefix directive. @multipath is cumulative, in that for
each @multipath in an ancestor a copy of the file is created. These
directives must at the beginning of the line and by themselves.</t>

The plugin will:

1)  Create a new node, under the current node, where the configuration will be
    written. This node will typically have references to several sections (see below).

2)  Create sections (child nodes) for the indented blocks present in the original
    config file. These child nodes will have sub-nodes grouping similar blocks (e.g.
    there will be an 'interface' child node, with as many sub-nodes as there are real
    interfaces in the configuration file).

3)  Create sections for the custom keywords specified in the customBlocks[] list in
    importCiscoConfig(). You can modify this list to specify different keywords. DO
    NOT put keywords that are followed by indented blocks (these are taken care of by
    point 2 above). The negated form of the keywords (for example, if the keyword is
    'service', the negated form is 'no service') is also included in the sections.

<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.3057">A plugin to create script buttons and @button, @plugin and @script nodes.
This plugin puts two buttons in the icon area: a button called run Script and
a button called script Button. The run Script button is simply another way
of doing the Execute Script command: it executes the selected text of the
presently selected node, or the entire text if no text is selected. The 'script
Button' button creates another button in the icon area every time you push it.
The name of the button is the headline of the presently selected node. Hitting
this _new_ button executes the button's script.

For example, to run a script on any part of an outline do the following:

1.  Select the node containing the script.
2.  Press the scriptButton button.  This will create a new button, call it X.
3.  Select the node on which you want to run the script.
4.  Push button X.

That's all.  You can delete a script button by right-clicking on it.
This plugin optionally scans for @button nodes, @plugin nodes and @script nodes
whenever a .leo file is opened.

- @button nodes create script buttons.
- @plugin nodes cause plugins to be loaded.
- @script nodes cause a script to be executed when opening a .leo file.

Such nodes may be security risks. This plugin scans for such nodes only if the
corresponding atButtonNodes, atPluginNodes, and atScriptNodes constants are set
to True in this plugin.</t>

plugin module for the Leo outlining editor.
For more information see:  http://www.marshallresearch.com/michael-dawson/os/leo.html
I am still using Leo version 4.1 (rc3, build 1.62), as I've been unable to keep
up with the speed of Edward's Leo development. He has made such significant
changes to Leo since 4.1 that I doubt that Leo2AsciiDoc will work with any
version later than 4.1. I do intend to rewrite Leo2AsciiDoc for the new Leo, but
there is no schedule set. 

Leo2AscDoc enables the contents of plain text Leo outlines to be published to HTML
or PDF via the AsciiDoc program and the DocBook set of publishing tools. Plain
text from the Leo outline can be transformed into a final result that has
typeset body text, in which bulleted and numbered lists, variable lists, page
numbers, URLs, index terms,and bold and italic text are automatically
recognized. typeset Headings a Table of Contents an Index containing any items
marked by the user, and any Python classes or functions. To produce HTML and
PDF, you'll need to have the AsciiDoc program installed (a trivial task) and a
DocBook tool chain installed, which is not a trivial task. And, of course,
Python and Leo. In sum, this little program is an easy install for people who
are already using Leo and DocBook. As noted later, Leo2AsciiDoc has only been
tested on Linux</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.3832">The rst3 plugin creates output files from Leo outlines containing rST
(reStructuredText_) markup. rst3 options control most aspects of this plugin's
operations. You can set options in @settings trees, in headlines and in body
text. There are too many options to describe here. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/rstplugin3.html for full documentation. To
use this plugin effectively, Python's docutils_ module must be installed. The
rst3 plugin will use the SilverCity_ syntax coloring package if it installed.

The rst3 plugin adds the Write Restructured Text command to Leo's Edit menu.
This command searches the selected outline looking for **rst root nodes** whose
headline have the form::

    @rst &lt;filename&gt;

The plugin then creates the named file in various ways depending which rst3
options are in effect. By default, the rst3 plugin creates rST headings
automatically from outlines, so the higher-level nodes in the outline correspond
to higher-level sections in the output. Creating rST headings automatically
eliminates one of the most tedious chores associated with rST markup.
This plugin sends .htm, .html or .tex files to the docutils module for further
processing. Docutils generates HTML files or LaTeX files depending on the file's
extension. HTML files generated by docutils refer to three .css (cascading style
sheet) files that should exist in the same directory as the generated HTML file.
You can control the formatting of the HTML file by altering these .css files.

For full details on this plugin, see http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/rstplugin3.html

A new method has been added to the rst3 plugin to make it more easily to drive
the plugin from scripts::

    def writeNodeToString (self,p=None,ext=None)

writeNodeToString scans p's tree (p defaults to presently selected node) looking for @rst nodes.
When the first @rst node is found, writeNodeToString processes the node as usual, with the following changes:

- @rst need not be followed by a filename; any filename and its extension are *ignored*.

- Only the ext argument to writeNodeToString determines the type of output produced.
  The valid values for the ext argument are None (for rst output), '.html', '.pdf', and '.tex'.

- Instead of writing the result to a file, writeNodeToString returns the tuple (p,s),
  where p is the node whose tree produced the output, and s is the output itself.

- writeNodeToString returns after processing at most one @rst node.

Scripts can easily use writeNodeToString to convert @rst trees into various kinds of output.
For example, here is the body of @button rst-&gt;html in LeoDocs.leo::

    import leo.core.leoPlugins as leoPlugins
    rst3 = leoPlugins.getPluginModule('rst3')
    if rst3:
        controller = rst3.controllers.get(c)
        if controller:
            p,s = controller.writeNodeToString(ext='.html')
            print '*' * 40,p
            print s

Notes:

- This script scans the presently selected tree for @rst nodes, just like the @button rst script does.
  In particular, if the presently selected tree does not contain an @rst node the search continues in parent trees.
  When an @rst node is found, it converts the node (and descendants) to html and returns p,
  the found @rst node and s, the html itself.

- The script shown above merely prints the output, but many other actions could be taken.
  In particular, because writeNodeToString returns p it would be possible to write a script that
  would scan multiple @rst nodes.

- None and '.tex' are also valid values for the ext argument to writeNodeToString.
  None converts the @rst tree to a single reStructuredText string, as shown in @button rst-&gt;rst.

- There is some support for ext='.pdf', but this is experimental code.  Expect crashes.</t>

hierarchal manner. Nodes that come before that contain @produce go first. I'm

to the Import menu and adds the 'View base64' command to the outline menu. The

The body of this node will kill the colorizer, add some info on the original
file and create a section reference to the payload node, which contains the
data. The Export base64 command asks for a location to place the file. The
plugin checks that the structure of the base64 node is what it expected,
basically what an import operation creates. If Ok, it will write the file to the
selected directory. The View base64 command brings up a Pmw Dialog that displays
the data as a PhotoImage. This currently only supports formats recognized by the
PhotoImage class. This would be the .gif format. This functionality may be

<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.647">A plugin to create and update @read-only nodes. I wanted to have the ability to
import files in "read-only" mode, that is, in a mode where files could only be
read by leo (not tangled), and also kept in sync with the content on the drive.
The reason for this is for example that I have external programs that generate
resource files. I want these files to be part of a leo outline, but I don't want
leo to tangle or in any way modify them. At the same time, I want them to be
up-to-date in the leo outline. This plugin has the following characteristics:

- It reads the specified file and puts it into the node content.

- If the @read-only directive was in the leo outline already, and the file content
  on disk has changed from what is stored in the outline, it marks the node as
  changed and prints a "changed" message to the log window; if, on the other hand,
  the file content has *not* changed, the file is simply read and the node is
  not marked as changed.

- When you write a @read-only directive, the file content is added to the node
  immediately, i.e. as soon as you press Enter (no need to call a menu
  entry to import the content).

- If you want to refresh/update the content of the file, just edit the headline
  and press Enter. The file is reloaded, and if in the meantime it has changed,
  a "change" message is sent to the log window.

- The body text of a @read-only file cannot be modified in leo.

The syntax to access files in @read-only via ftp/http is the following::

    @read-only http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0791.txt
    @read-only ftp://ftp.someserver.org/filepath

If FTP authentication (username/password) is required, it can be specified as follows::

    @read-only ftp://username:password@ftp.someserver.org/filepath</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.674">Runs a program and interface Leo through its input/output/error streams.
Double clicking the icon box whose headlines are @run 'cmd args' will execute
the command. There are several other features, including @arg and @input nodes.

The run_nodes.py plugin introduce two new nodes that transform leo into a
terminal. It was mostly intended to run compilers and debuggers while having the
possibility to send messages to the program.

- Double clicking on the icon of an node whose headline is::

    @run &lt;command&gt; &lt;args&gt;

will launch &lt;command&gt; with the given arguments. It will also mark the node. #
Terminates the argument list. @run # &lt;comment&gt; is also valid.

- @in nodes are used to send input to the running process. Double clicking
  on the icon of an @in &lt;message&gt; node will append a "\n" to &lt;message&gt; and
  write it to the program, no matter where the node is placed. If no @run node is
  active, nothing happens.

- The body text of every child, in which the headlines do not begin with @run
  or @in, will be appended to &lt;command&gt;, allowing you to add an infinite number
  of arguments to &lt;command&gt;.

- The output of the program is written in the log pane (Error outputted in red).
  When the program exit the node is set unmarked and the return value is
  displayed...When the enter key is pressed in the body pane of an active @run
  node the content of it body pane is written to the program and then emptied
  ready for another line of input. If the node have @run nodes in its descendants,
  they will be launched successively (unless one returned an exit code other
  than 0, then it will stop there).</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.694">Launches (starts) a file given by a headline when double-clicking the icon.
Ignores headlines starting with an '@'. Uses the @folder path if the headline
is under an @folder headline. Otherwise the path is relative to the Leo file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.699">The AutoTrees plugin is a helper plugin designed to make it very easy to write
"handler" plugins to manage dynamic content in Leo outlines. AutoTrees provides:

- Convenient handler base classes which can be specialized for particular uses.
- A manager to turn handlers on and off.
- A set of example handlers to show the kinds of things that are possible.

AutoTrees doesn't do anything that you cannot do in other ways, but it does
provide a consistent way of adding dynamic content. This means that individual
plugin writers don't have to rewrite all the same kinds of code each time and
also makes it easier to maintain Leo, since it standardizes the way that certain
classes of plugin interact with the Leo core. Why use this? I'm a plugin writer
and I want to write a plugin to display dynamic content, i.e., content not
directly contained in the .leo or external files, e.g.,

- email messages 
- news feeds
- news groups
- documentation
- remote files
- statistics
- file system data
- data base records

You can do this as a standard plugin, but as an AutoTrees handler you,

- don't need to write code that interacts with the tree (this is done for you)
- get centralized management
- can still do everything else you could as a normal plugin

<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.82">Supports new Leo directives.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.85">This plugin manages BibTeX files with Leo. Create a bibliographic database by
putting @bibtex filename in a headline. Entries are added as nodes, with
@entrytype key as the headline, and the contents of the entry in body text.
The plugin will automatically insert a template for the entry in the body pane
when a new entry is created (hooked to pressing enter when typing the headline
text). The templates are defined in dictionary templates in the \&lt;\&lt;globals\&gt;\&gt;
section, by default containing all required fields for every entry.

The file is written by double-clicking the node. Thus the following outline::

    -@bibtex biblio.bib
     +@book key
      author = {A. Uthor},
      year = 1999

will be written in the file 'biblio.bib' as::

    @book{key,
    author = {A. Uthor},
    year= 1999}

Strings are defined in @string nodes and they can contain multiple entries.
All @string nodes are written at the start of the file. Thus the following
outline::

    -@bibtext biblio.bib
     +@string
      j1 = {Journal}
     +@article AUj1
      author = {A. Uthor},
      journal = j1
     +@string
      j2 = {Journal2}
      j3 = {Journal3}

Will be written as::

    @string{j1 = {Journal1}}
    @string{j2 = {Journal2}}
    @string{j3 = {Journal3}}

    @article{AUj1,
    author = {A. Uthor},
    journal = j1}

No error checking is made on the syntax. The entries can be organized under
nodes--if the headline doesn't start with '@', the headline and body text are
ignored, but the child nodes are parsed as usual. BibTeX files can be imported
by creating an empty node with @bibtex filename in the headline.
Double-clicking it will read the file filename and parse it into a
@bibtex tree. No syntax checking is made, filename is expected to be a
valid BibTeX file.</t>

scriptable context menus.

Named menus defined in scripts or @popup &lt;name&gt; settings can be associated with any widget.

Menu items may have icons and the foreground/background colors can be set in @popup settings.

<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.904">Autocompletion and calltips plugin.

- . summons the autocompletion.
- ( summons the calltips
- Escape closes either box.
- Ctrl selects an item.
- alt-up_arrow, alt-down_arrow move up or down in the list.
  The mouse will work for this as well.

This plugin scans the complete outline at startup.
You many enable or disable features in autocompleter.ini.
This file contains two options under the [ autocompleter ] section::

    useauto
    usecalltips

Setting either to 1 will turn on the feature. 0 means off. If there is a section
called [ newlanguages ] it will read each option as a new language for
autocompleter to recognize, and compile its value as a regex pattern for the
autocompleter system to recognize as a calltip. This has relevance for the .ato
system described below.  Languages that currently have patterns::

    python, java, c++, c, perl

Autocompleter looks in the plugin directory for a directory called
autocompleter. If it doesn't find one it will attempt to create this directory.
This directory should contain what are called .ato files ( pronounced auto ).
Autocompleter will scan each .ato file that has a first part that matches a
languages name. For example: python.ato autocompleter recognizes python, and
will scan this file. The contents are read with the same mechanism that reads
the information in the nodes, so calltip and autocompleter information is added
to autocompleter's runtime database. If a new language has been added in the
autocompleter.ini file then an .ato file that starts with the new languages name
will be recognized and read in. Note, this language needs to be recognizable to
Leo. Used correctly an .ato file is a mechanism by which a user can carry
autocompletion and calltip information between .leo files/sessions.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.942">Handle coloring for markup in doc parts and Python triple-double-quoted strings.

**Important**:

- This plugin requires that the add_directives plugin is enabled.

- To color a text with wiki markup the text must be in the range of an @markup wiki directive.

The currently supported markups are::

    ''text''                    # write text in italics
    __text__                    # write text in bold
    ~~&lt;color&gt;:text~~            # write text in the color specified by &lt;color&gt; (e.g. blue, grey, etc)
    {picture file=&lt;filename&gt;}   # load the picture indicated by &lt;filename&gt;
    http://url                  # URL support: double clicking on the url will open it in the default browser.
    https://url                 # URL support: double clicking on the url will open it in the default browser.

-   Note 1: italics and bold markups can be nested, e.g.,::

        ''__text__''            # write text in italics and bold

    Just remember to terminate the tags in the order they were opened.

- Note 2: URLs must be terminated by a space.

By default, once the text has been markup up, the actual tags (e.g. '__' for
bold) are not displayed anymore. You can choose to display them selecting "Show
Invisibles" from the Edit menu.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.98">This plugin is enhances the EditAttributes.py plugin. It puts a command in
Outline called ConceptualSort. This will prompt you for a concept to sort by.
This gives the user some more flexibility in how they want to arrange their
nodes. Nodes without the attribute in question go to the bottom of the sort.
The user can:

- Select which attribute he wants to sort on by clicking on the Attribute box.

- Select the type of sort he wants by clicking on the radio buttons:

    -   Normal.
    -   Reversed. Like normal but the results are reversed.
    -   Used defined. For advanced users. The text box is where a user can type in

        like::

            def( a, b, att ):

where a and b are nodes and att is dictionary of the nodes and the respective

- The usual assortment of bug fixes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050917092557.1">Here is a summary of the changes:

- General: All chapters created with rst3 plugin. This ensures a uniform look.
The source is in LeoDocs.leo. Removed all references to older versions of Leo,
except when discussing old file formats in the Appendices. Corrected all text so
it discusses present version.

- rst3 plugin itself: Correct bug that caused chapters to be formatted
differently when processing multiple @rst trees.

- rst3 button in LeoDocs.leo: The script first looks *up* the tree, looking for
an @rst node. If found, it processes just that tree. If not found, it processes
all @rst nodes *below* the originally selected node. The button is now much more
convenient to use.

- Preface: Shorter, no history. No longer a dead end.

- What People are Saying About Leo: No longer a dead end.

- FAQ: Reorganized, simplified, revised. Added entries for running Leo in a
console window and debugging docutils. Improved entry for using cvs.

- Chapter 1: Installation: Now the first chapter. Revised.

- Chapter 2: Tutorial: Completely rewritten. Like Python's tutorial, this
chapter contains everything a beginner needs to understand and use Leo. The
`Quickstart for programmers` section is the heart of this chapter. All terms
used have links either to their definition in the tutorial or in the Glossary.
Newbies should be able to digest this chapter easily. This chapter should make
Leo comprehensible to many more people.

- Chapter 3: Using Outlines: Revised per general remarks above.

- Chapter 4: Writing Programs in Leo. Completely rewritten. The old chapter was
an embarrassment. The new chapter is a reference guide, properly organized as
such. The introduction warns newbies away.

- Chapter 5: Using Leo's Commands. 'Minor' revisions and corrections create a
substantially better result.

- Chapter 6: Leo and literate programming: Reformatting helps. New words about
rST markup and other improvements over traditional LP.

- Chapter 7: Scripting Leo with Python: Rewritten, simplified, updated and
corrected. The sources in LeoDocs.leo are directly executable. rST sources use
literal blocks instead of code-blocks so that the sources are simplified.
(Important when executing examples). Properly discusses positions, including
'supremely important' section on copying positions.

- Chapter 8: Customizing Leo. Heavily revised. Discusses leoSettings.leo, not
leoConfig.txt. Security warnings are more reasonable. Section on script buttons.
Rewrote section on uA's (Adding extensible attributes to nodes and .leo files).

- Chapter 9: History of Leo. Rewritten. Much shorter and more useful. Discusses
the major milestones, concentrating on explaining the major differences between
versions. Gone are details of how discoveries came to be. They are in
LeoPostings.leo, which will be included in the distribution.

- Chapter 10: Theory of Operation. Largely rewritten. Discusses positions
properly. Omits discussion of how clones were implemented before 4.2.

- Chapter 11: White Papers. A new chapter. This is a slightly-edited version of
writing that had been buried in the appendices.

- Appendices. Heavily revised and reformatted. Rewrote sections on file formats.

- Glossary: A separate chapter. All terms have links to their definition. All
definitions are rST targets so other chapters may refer to them. Added several
new entries.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050917092557.10">This plugin now allows quotes within words, but strips quotes and other cruft
from the beginning and end of words. As a result, using the spellpyx spell
checker is much easier than before.

Leo's extensions folder now contains aspell23.pyd and aspell24.pyd. These are
Python dll's compiled for Python 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. You must rename one
of these files to be aspell.pyd and move aspell.pyd to the aspell folder. For
more details, see the installation nodes in the docstring for the spellpyx
plugin.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050917092557.11">These plugins now use Python's subprocess module if it is present. The
subprocess module comes standard with Python 2.4. For Linux systems, Leo will
use subprocess.py in Leo's extensions folder if necessary.

For Windows systems you can install Python's subprocess module in Python 2.2 or
2.3 as follows:
    
    - Go to http://www.effbot.org/downloads/#subprocess

    - Download and execute one of the following installers, depending on your version of Python:
        subprocess-0.1-20041012.win32-py2.3.exe 
        subprocess-0.1-20041012.win32-py2.2.exe
        
This installer installs the subprocess sources and also _subprocess.pyd in Python's site-packages folder.

- Strip trailing blanks in get.
- Many improvement to doOp.
- Improved DoMultiline:
    - Added special case logic to ensure '#' is preceded by space except at start of line.
    - Added blank after multi-line string if needed.
- Added lastName token for special-case handling depending on previous token.
- No change to put, putArray or doName.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050917092557.9">See http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/rstplugin3.html for full documentation
of this plugin.

The rst3 plugin creates output files from Leo outlines containing
reStructuredText (rST) ReStructuredText is a simple and powerful text formatting
markup language. Outlines are a natural way to organize rST (or any text).

This plugin adds the Write Restructured Text command to Leo's Edit menu. The
Write Restructured Text command searches the selected outline looking for rst
root nodes whose headline have the form @rst &lt;filename&gt;. The plugin then creates
the named file in various ways depending which rst3 options are in effect.

By default, the rst3 plugin creates rST headings automatically from outlines, so
the higher-level nodes in the outline correspond to higher-level sections in the
output. Creating rST headings automatically relieves you from one of the most
tedious chores in creating rST markup.

To use this plugin effectively, Python's docutils module must be installed. The
rst3 plugin will use the SilverCity syntax coloring package if it installed.

This plugin sends .htm, .html or .tex files to the docutils module for further
processing. Docutils generates HTML files or LaTeX files depending on the file's
extension. HTML files generated by docutils refer to three .css (cascading style
sheet) files that should exist in the same directory as the generated HTML file.
You can control the formatting of the HTML file by altering these .css files.</t>

Leo 4.4 a4 introduces the 'Newer World Order' for redrawing the screen,
corrects numerous bugs in the 4.4 code base, and introduces several new features.

You should be able to use this version safely. There are no known serious bugs,
but several minibuffer commands are not ready for prime time. All the major
features of 4.4 are in place.

To learn about Leo, see: http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
----------------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name. Support for tab completion.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Support for almost all commands in the Emacs Cmds menu, including cursor
and screen movement, basic character, word and paragraph manipulation, and
commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring, regions and rectangles.

- Per-pane key bindings. You can bind shortcuts to multiple commands depending
on which of Leo's panes presently has focus. For example, you can use arrow keys
to move nodes in the outline pane, while retaining their defaults in Leo's body
pane. Per-pane key bindings are essential for mouseless Leo.

- @command nodes create minibuffer commands. You can bind key shortcuts to
@button and @command nodes.

- A rewrite of Leo's keystroke handling. In particular, Leo handles key events
immediately rather than queuing them for idle time.

- Leo recovers from crashes much more reliably than in any previous version.

- Leo updates the screen immediately rather than waiting for idle time.
This 'Newer World Order' simplifies the code and improves performance.

Known bugs in Leo 4.4a4
-----------------------
- Several minibuffer commands do not work.  See the release notes for details.

Coming in later releases of Leo 4.4:
------------------------------------
- An auto-complete command that shows class members in the Completion tab.

- More support for mouseless Leo. There will be commands to manipulate all
aspects of Leo using commands, so your fingers will never have to leave the
keyboard.

- Support for Vim and other 'plain-key' input modes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.1">Here are the default bindings relating to the minibuffer. Any of
these may be changed by changing @shortcuts nodes in leoSettings.leo.

Alt-x: Just like Emacs: starts minibuffer. The prompt is 'full-command' Type a
full command name, then hit &lt;Return&gt; to execute the command. Tab completion
works, but not for file names.

Alt-c: Like Emacs Control-C: (Ctrl-C conflicts with XP cut). starts minibuffer.
The prompt is 'quick-command'. This mode is not completed, but stuff like
`Ctrl-C r` and `Ctrl r r` do work.

Alt-u: Like Emacs Ctrl-u: (Ctrl-u conflicts with move-outline-up). Add a repeat
count for later command. Ctrl-u 999 a adds 999 a's, but many features remain
unfinished.

Ctrl-g: Just like Emacs Ctrl-g: Closes the mini-buffer.

The @bool useMinibuffer setting in leoSettings.leo just controls whether the
minibuffer is visible. The minibuffer exists (and you can type into it) even if
it isn't visible! You can use the show-mini-buffer, hide-mini-buffer and
toggle-mini-buffer commands to show or hide the minibuffer.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.10">Leo maintains the following dictionaries.  As usual, k refers to c.keyHandler:

- c.keyHandler.registerCommand can be called from scripts to register new alt-x
  commands. It probably won't work from plugins yet.

New dictionaries and methods make it easier to customize and extend Leo:

- c.commandsDict describes all commands. Keys are full Emacs command names;
values are functions f.

- k.inverseCommandsDict: keys are f.__name__, values are emacs command names.

- k.leoCallbackDict: keys are leoCallback functions, values are called
functions.

- k.bindingsDict: keys are shortcuts, values are g.bunches with the following
    members: func, name, warningGiven, fromMenu.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.11">The following helper functions make it easy to discover the binding presently in

- k.getShortcutForCommandName(self,commandName) returns the shortcut given
  f.__name__.

- k.getShortcutForCommand(self,f) returns the shortcut for f.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.12">@nocolor

c.keyHandlerregisterCommand (self,commandName,shortcut,func)

This function make the func available as a minibuffer command, and optionally
binds a shortcut to func. You can wrap any method in a function, so the
restriction to functions is not significant.

Here is an example take from an @button node::

@color

k = c.keyHandler

def f (event):
    g.es_print('Hello',color='purple')

k.registerCommand('print-hello','Alt-Ctrl-Shift-p',f)

<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.15">Added big kludge to menu.createMenuEntries so that f.OnCut/Copy/PasteFromMenu get called
**only** when explicitly selected from the menu (rather than from a shortcut).
This allows the code in cut/copy/paste-text to be different as needed.

Users can override the shortcut by assigning shortcuts to cut/copy/paste-text commands.
The shortcut will appear in the menu, but does **not** get bound to c.frame.menu.

This is an essential step in solving the infamous Control-V problem.
The code appears to work properly on XP.  Not tested other places.

This is the last best hope to solve this problem: the code interacts as little as possible with Tk.</t>

The scripting plugin has been improved as follows:

1. You can bind shortcuts in @button nodes.  Like this:

@button name @key=shortcut

This binds the shortcut to the script in the script button. The button's name is
'name', but you can see the full headline in the status line when you move the
mouse over the button. This is a clean and simple way of discovering the
shortcut.

2. You can create your own minibuffer commands with @command nodes.

A node whose headline has the form:

@command command-name

a new minibuffer command whose name is 'command-name'.

A node whose headline has the form:

@command command-name @key=shortcut

creates new minibuffer command and binds shortcut to it.

3. The scripting plugin no longer contains the 'bindLate' code-level option. The
scripts for all @button or @command nodes are computed 'dynamically', that is,
when the button is pushed or the command is executed from the minibuffer. This
is the most useful way, and the most intuitive.

Previously, scripts for @button nodes were never dynamic, while scripts in
@button nodes created by the 'Script button' button were dynamic only if
bindLate was True. You could call this a bug: it was unhelpful, annoying and
confusing.

4. The scripting plugin no longer prints an 'end of script' message. This allows
scripts to select tabs in the log pane</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051616.172">@color

# Plugins and scripts can easily create new tabs in the log panel.
# Important: you can run any of these examples using the 'Run Script' button.

# To create a tab named "Test" or make it visible if it already exists:
 
c.frame.log.selectTab('Test')

# When first created, a tab contains a text widget.
# To write to this widget, add the tabName argument to g.es:

g.es('Test',color='blue',tabName='Test')

# Plugins and scripts can easily replace the default Text widget with other Tk widgets.
# c.frame.log.tabFrame contains the Tk.Frame that contains all the other widgets of the frame.
# c.frame.log.logCtrl contains the Tk.Text widget that is initially the only widget in this frame.
# So to remove this text widget just do:
    
c.frame.log.logCtrl.pack_forget()

# Now you can pack any other widgets into c.frame.log.tabFrame.

import Tkinter as Tk ; log = c.frame.log
log.selectTab('Test')
log.logCtrl.pack_forget()
f = Tk.Frame(log.tabFrame,bg='red',height='1inch',width='2inch')
f.pack(side='left',expand=0,fill='none')</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051616.299">Leo can optionally generate matching brackets depending on the setting:

@bool autocomplete-brackets = TrueOrFalse

If True, Leo will immediately type the corresponding closing bracket whenever
you type a '(', '[' or '{' character. You can use the forward-char command to
move past the closing bracket, and Leo will move past any closing bracket if you
type the closing bracket with the cursor just to the left of a closing bracket.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028061322">**Important**: The print-bindings and print-commands commands (new in a1) show
what commands exist and what keys are bound to them.

- The help command tells how to use the minibuffer.

- The show-minibuffer, hide-minibuffer and toggle-mini-buffer commands show and hide the minibuffer.

It *is* possible to execute these command even if the minibuffer isn't presently
visible. For example, typing 

&lt;alt-x&gt;toggle-mini-buffer&lt;return&gt;

should always work.

- The open-find-tab command opens the Find tab. The Find tab replaces the old
Find panel. The Find panel is deprecated.

- The open-spell-tab command opens the Spell-checking tab.

- The show-colors command creates the 'Colors' tab in the log pane. This tab allows you to
experiment with picking fonts.

- The show-fonts command creates the 'Fonts' tab in the log pane. This tab allows you to
experiment with picking colors.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101161405">At the bottom of Leo's window you will now see an area labeled the mini-buffer.
You can't type in it directly, you activate the buffer by typing Alt-x or Alt-c.
Typing Alt-x takes you to 'full-command' mode. Type the full name of a command,
followed by a 'return'. 

- To get help, type Alt-x help.
- For a list of commands, type Alt-x print-commands.
- For a list of present key bindings, type Alt-x print-bindings.
- To leave the mini-buffer at any time type Ctrl-g.

Note: you can redefine any of these keys as you wish.

Important: you can execute any of Leo's 'legacy' commands from the mini-buffer.
For example, Alt-x about-leo or Alt-x open-find-dialog. Note: Leo's Find
*dialog* is deprecated. You will find it much more convenient to use Leo's new
Find *tab*. Use the open-find-tab command.

You can use tab-completion in the minibuffer to cycle through the list of
commands that start with what is in the buffer. Typing backspace takes you back
to the what you previously typed (less on character.) The 'Completion' tab shows
all possible completions. This tab appears automatically when you type a tab in
the minibuffer.

The mini-buffer reduces the need for shortcuts dramatically. For example, none
of Leo's import commands need a shortcut because it is easy enough to execute
them from the minibuffer. In particular, executing commands from the minibuffer
is much easier than executing commands by hand from a menu. </t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101161405.1">leoSettings.leo contains one functional @shortcuts node and one disabled
@@shortcuts node. These node contain entries for every command.

You can assign key shortcuts to any command, as discussed in the comments in
that file. You can leave the nodes as they are, use them as base for
modifications, or roll your own. You should define a binding for every function,
even if that binding is 'None'. If you don't, Leo will issue a warning.

Leo now supports per-pane bindings.  Bindings of the form:

command-name ! pane = shortcut

bind the shortcut to the command only withing a single pane. The possible values
for 'pane' are:

pane    affected panes
----    --------------
all     body,log,tree
body    body
log     log
mini    minibuffer
text    body,log
tree    tree</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101161405.2">The scripting plugin has been improved in two ways:

1. You can specify key bindings in @button nodes as follows:

@button name @key=shortcut

This binds the shortcut to the script in the script button. The button's name is
'name', but you can see the full headline in the status line when you move the
mouse over the button.

2. You can create new minibuffer commands with @command nodes:

@command name @key=shortcut

This creates a new minibuffer command and binds shortcut to it.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101161405.3">Abbreviations may not work at present. A new kind of abbreviation is presently
hard coded in add_ekr_altx_commands in leoKeys.py. For example, one ekr-shortcut
is: 'f', which is bound to leo-find-panel. Typing Alt-x f Return executes
leo-find-panel. These may be quicker than Emacs abbreviations, or not.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101161949"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101162123">These 'hard-coded' bindings are no longer needed and interfere with per-pane bindings.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101162123.1">- The open-find-tab command opens the Find tab.

- The open-spell-tab command opens the Spell-checking tab.

The Find and Spell *tabs* replace the corresponding legacy *dialogs*. Using tabs
eliminates previous problems with dialogs obscuring Leo's main window.

Two essential components of the settings dialog now are implemented in the tabbed log:

- The show-colors command creates the 'Colors' tab in the log pane.

- The show-fonts command creates the 'Fonts' tab in the log pane.

These two tabs allow you to pick color or font names without using the @settings dialog.

Important: scripts and plugins can easily create new tabs in the Log pane. See
Chapter 7 of the Users Guide for details.</t>

This release completes the last major features of Leo 4.4:

- User-specified key-binding modes.
- Support for multiple key-bindings for individual minibuffer commands.

This will be the last alpha version of Leo 4.4. Beta 1 is coming in about a
week. You should be able to use this version safely; there are no known serious
bugs.

To learn about Leo, see: http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
----------------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name. Support for tab completion.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Support for most commands in the Emacs Cmds menu, including cursor and screen
movement, basic character, word and paragraph manipulation, and commands to
manipulate buffers, the kill ring, regions and rectangles.

- Per-pane key bindings. You can bind shortcuts to multiple commands depending
on which of Leo's panes presently has focus. For example, you can use arrow keys
to move nodes in the outline pane, while retaining their defaults in Leo's body
pane.

- User-specified key-binding modes. This feature makes it possible to emulate all
aspects of Emacs and Vim as far as key bindings are concerned.

- @command nodes create minibuffer commands. You can bind key shortcuts to
@button and @command nodes.

- Leo recovers from crashes much more reliably than in any previous version.

- Leo handles keystrokes and updates the screen immediately rather than waiting
for idle time.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20051219150602.105">Leo now supports the following commands, shown below with their present bindings:

back-char ! text = LtArrow
back-char-extend-selection ! text = Shift-LtArrow
back-paragraph ! text = Alt-braceleft 
back-paragraph-extend-selection ! text = Alt-Shift-braceleft
back-sentence ! text = Alt-a 
back-sentence-extend-selection  = None
back-word ! text = Alt-b  # No conflict   
back-word-extend-selection  ! text = Alt-Shift-b
beginning-of-buffer ! text = Alt-less # Note: same as Alt-Shift-less
beginning-of-buffer-extend-selection  = None
beginning-of-line ! text = Ctrl-a
beginning-of-line-extend-selection = None
exchange-point-mark = None
forward-char ! text = RtArrow
forward-char-extend-selection ! text = Shift-RtArrow
forward-paragraph ! text = Alt-braceright
forward-paragraph-extend-selection ! text = Alt-Shift-braceright
forward-sentence ! text = Alt-e
forward-sentence-extend-selection ! text = Alt-Shift-e
forward-word ! text = Alt-f
forward-word-extend-selection ! text = Alt-Shift-f
next-line ! text = DnArrow
next-line-extend-selection  ! text = Shift-DnArrow
previous-line ! text = Uparrow
previous-line-extend-selection ! text = Shift-UpArrow

The -extend-selection variants move the cursor and also extend the selection
from the insert point in the indicated direction. As usual exchange-point-mark
switches the insert point from one side of the selection to the other: which
side of the selection the insert point is on does make a difference.

I also added three commands that implement so-called 'extend mode':

clear-extend-mode = None
set-extend-mode = None
toggle-extend-mode = None

When extend mode is on (it is off at first), all cursor movement commands listed
above extend the selection. Very handy. Thanks to Brian for this suggestion.

This is the start of mouseless Leo. For the first time all the common Emacs
cursor-movement commands exist. These commands should work in any text widget.</t>

Important: you can use the show-colors and show-fonts commands to help set

<t tx="ekr.20060105214753">Leo now allows you to specify input modes. You enter mode x with the
enter-x-mode command. The purpose of a mode is to create different bindings
for keys within a mode. Often plain keys are useful in input modes.

You can specify modes with @mode nodes in leoSettings.leo. @mode nodes work
just like @shortcuts nodes, but in addition they have the side effect of
creating the enter-&lt;mode name&gt;-mode command.

Notes:

- You can exit any mode using the keyboard-quit (Control-g) command. This is the
  **only** binding that is automatically created in each mode. All other bindings
  must be specified in the @mode node. In particular, the bindings specified in
  @shortcuts nodes are **not** in effect in mode (again, except for the
  keyboard-quit binding).

- Leo supports something akin to tab completion within modes: if you type a key
  that isn't bound in a mode a 'Mode' tab will appear in the log pane. This tab
  shows all the keys that you can type and the commands to which they are bound.
  The mode-help command does the same thing.

- @shortcuts nodes specify the bindings for what might be called the 'top-level'
  mode. These are the bindings in effect when no internal state is present, for
  example, just after executing the keyboard-quit command.

- The top_level_unbound_key_action setting determines what happens to
  unbound keys in the top-level mode. Leo ignores unbound keys in all other modes.
  The possibilities are 'insert', 'replace' and 'ignore'.

- The set-insert-mode, set-overwrite-mode and set-ignore-mode
  commands alter what happens to unbound keys in the top-level mode.

With all these options it should be possible to emulate the keyboard behavior of any other editor.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060111192108">A **dangerous** delete is a deletion of a node so that all the data in the node
is deleted *everywhere* in an outline. The data is gone, to be retrieved only
via undo or via backups. It may not be obvious which deletes are dangerous in an
outline containing clones. Happily, there is a very simple rule of thumb::

    Deleting a non-cloned node is *always* dangerous.
    Deleting a cloned node is *never* dangerous.

We could also consider a delete to be dangerous **if it results in a node being
omitted from an external file.** This can happen as follows. Suppose we have the
following outline (As usual, A' indicates that A is marked with a clone mark)::

    - @thin spam.py
        - A'
            - B
    - Projects
        - A'
            - B

Now suppose we clone B, and move the clone so the tree looks like this::

    - @thin spam.py
        - A'
            - B'
    - Projects
        - A'
            - B'
        - B'

If (maybe much later), we eliminate B' as a child of A will get::

    - @thin spam.py
        - A'
    - Projects
        - A'
        - B

B has not been destroyed, but B is gone from @thin spam.py! So in this sense deleting a clone node can also be called dangerous.</t>

The code is stable; there are no known serious bugs. Some features are
incomplete.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
--------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Dozens of other new features and bug fixes since Leo 4.3.3.

<t tx="ekr.20060212102459.4">All minibuffer search commands, with the exception of the isearch (incremental) commands, simply provide a minibuffer interface to Leo's legacy find commands.  This means that all the powerful features of Leo's legacy commands are available to the minibuffer search commands.

Note: all bindings shown are the default bindings for these commands.  You may change any of these bindings using @shortcuts nodes in leoSettings.leo.

Settings

leoSettings.leo now contains several settings related to the Find tab:

- @bool show_only_find_tab_options = True

When True (recommended), the Find tab does not show the 'Find', 'Change', 'Change, Then Find', 'Find All' and 'Change All' buttons.

- @bool minibufferSearchesShowFindTab = True

When True, Leo shows the Find tab when executing most of the commands discussed below.  It's not necessary for it to be visible, but I think it provides good feedback about what search-with-present-options does.  YMMY.  When True, the sequence Control-F, Control-G is one way to show the Find Tab.

Basic find commands

- The open-find-tab command makes the Find tab visible.  The Find tab does **not** need to be visible to execute any search command discussed below.

- The hide-find-tab commands hides the Find tab, but retains all the present settings.

- The search-with-present-options command (Control-F) prompts for a search string.  Typing the &lt;Return&gt; key puts the search string in the Find tab and executes a search based on all the settings in the Find tab.   This command is my 'workhorse' search command.

- The show-search-options command shows the present search options in the status line.  At present, this command also shows the Find tab.

Search again commands

- The find-tab-find command (F3) is the same as the search-with-present-options command, except that it uses the search string in the find-tab.  This is what I use as my default 'search again' command.

- Similarly, the find-tab-find-previous command (F2) repeats the command specified by the Find tab, but in reverse.

- The find-again command a combination of the search-with-present-options and find-tab-find command.  It is the same as the find-tab-find command if a search pattern other than '&lt;find pattern here&gt;' exists in the Find tab.  Otherwise, the find-again is the same as the search-with-present-options command.

Setting find options

- Several minibuffer commands toggle the checkboxes and radio buttons in the Find tab, and thus affect the operation of the search-with-present-options command. Some may want to bind these commands to keys. Others, will prefer to toggle options in a mode.


Here are the commands that toggle checkboxes: toggle-find-ignore-case-option, toggle-find-in-body-option, toggle-find-in-headline-option, toggle-find-mark-changes-option, toggle-find-mark-finds-option, toggle-find-regex-option, toggle-find-reverse-option, toggle-find-word-option, and toggle-find-wrap-around-option.

Here are the commands that set radio buttons: set-find-everywhere, set-find-node-only, and set-find-suboutline-only.

- The enter-find-options-mode (Ctrl-Shift-F) enters a mode in which you may change all checkboxes and radio buttons in the Find tab with plain keys.  As always, you can use the mode-help (Tab) command to see a list of key bindings in effect for the mode.

Search commands that set options as a side effect

The following commands set an option in the Find tab, then work exactly like the search-with-present-options command.

- The search-backward and search-forward commands set the 'Whole Word' checkbox to False.

- The word-search-backward and word-search-forward set the 'Whole Word' checkbox to True.

- The re-search-forward and re-search-backward set the 'Regexp' checkbox to True.

Find all commands

- The find-all command prints all matches in the log pane.

- The clone-find-all command replaces the previous 'Clone Find' checkbox.  It prints all matches in the log pane, and creates a node at the beginning of the outline containing clones of all nodes containing the 'find' string.  Only one clone is made of each node, regardless of how many clones the node has, or of how many matches are found in each node.

Note: the radio buttons in the Find tab (Entire Outline, Suboutline Only and Node only) control how much of the outline is affected by the find-all and clone-find-all commands.

Search and replace commands

The replace-string prompts for a search string.  Type &lt;Return&gt; to end the search string.  The command will then prompt for the replacement string.  Typing a second &lt;Return&gt; key will place both strings in the Find tab and executes a **find** command, that is, the search-with-present-options command.

So the only difference between the replace-string and search-with-present-options commands is that the replace-string command has the side effect of setting 'change' string in the Find tab.  However, this is an extremely useful side effect, because of the following commands...

- The find-tab-change command (Ctrl-=) replaces the selected text with the 'change' text in the Find tab.

- The find-tab-change-then-find (Ctrl--) replaces the selected text with the 'change' text in the Find tab, then executes the find command again.

The find-tab-find, find-tab-change and find-tab-change-then-find commands can simulate any kind of query-replace command.  **Important**: Leo presently has separate query-replace and query-replace-regex commands, but they are buggy and 'under-powered'.  Fixing these commands has low priority.

- The find-tab-change-all command changes all occurrences of the 'find' text with the 'change' text.  Important: the radio buttons in the Find tab (Entire Outline, Suboutline Only and Node only) control how much of the outline is affected by this command.

Incremental search commands

Leo's incremental search commands are completely separate from Leo's legacy search commands.  At present, incremental search commands do not cross node boundaries: they work only in the body text of single node.

Coming in Leo 4.4b3: the incremental commands will maintain a list of previous matches.  This allows for

a) support for backspace and
b) an incremental-search-again command.

Furthermore, this list makes it easy to detect the end of a wrapped incremental search.

Here is the list of incremental find commands: isearch-backward, isearch-backward-regexp, isearch-forward and
isearch-forward-regexp.'''</t>

Leo 4.4 b2 was broken on some platforms.  Leo 4.4 a6 should fix those problems
forever.  However, only wider distribution will verify that for certain.

Besides fixing the fatal problems with Leo 4.4b2, this version fixes two minor bugs
and adds some new settings in leoSettings.leo.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4 b2 and a6:
----------------------------
- Smoother user interface.
- New commands that support mouseless Leo.
- Minibuffer search commands provide all features of Leo's legacy search commands.
- User modes are fully functional; you can create special bindings for the minibuffer.
- New master key and click handlers and improved allocation of screen widgets.

Coming in Leo 4.4b3:
--------------------
- A revived chapters plugin.
- Autocompleter Tab.
- Improved incremental searches.

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
--------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Dozens of other new features and bug fixes since Leo 4.3.3.

<t tx="ekr.20060217071505.1">The new scheme binds to keystrokes, not commands.  This should be as portable
and robust as all previous versions (except b2, which was broken).

- Created k.completeAllBindings, called last in k.makeAllBindings. This binds
all keystrokes in k.bindingsDict to k.masterKeyHandler with an optional stroke
argument. This allows k.masterKeyhandler to dispense with the problematic call
to k.strokeFromEvent. This is all that is really required. 

- Added code to menu.createMenuEntries that clears the accelerator on MacOS for
any key that isn't a control, alt or command key. This solves the recurring
problems with the Return key. The only effect is that the menu won't mention a
binding that is actually in effect, but apparently that cannot be helped.

- Added g.safeCompareStrings, which may, or may not, fix the crasher when
comparing k.abortAllModesKey to the incoming keystroke in k.masterKeyHandler.
It's a bit tricky to test.

This white paper originally appeared in November 2003 as a series of postings to comp.lang.python.
Many features have been added since then.
I rewrote this paper in February 2006.

Those who use Leo know that it is a superb environment for
programming, authoring and managing data and project.
Leo's power comes from combining just two basic elements:

- The organization power of outlines, including clones.
- The power and simplicity of the Python language.

This paper explains in detail how combining these two features can, in fact,
create immense and largely unexpected power and flexibility.
To summarize:

- Outlines with clones are a superb filing cabinet for organizing text,
  including programs and scripts, or in fact any other information.
  This is the obvious aspect of outlines, but it is by no means the most powerful.

- Scripts can be composed of multiple nodes using noweb markup.
  Not only do outlines organize scripts, but scripts can be composed of outlines.
  In other words, Leo can *compose* scripts by concatenating descendant nodes and sections.
  Leo uses the noweb markup language to compose scripts in a flexible manner.

- Outline nodes split text, including programs and scripts, into *easily accessible*, discreet parts.
  Scripts may access nodes and their headlines and body text without any parsing.

- Nodes provide an easy associating the *description* of data with the data itself.
  Indeed, headlines naturally describe the node's body text.
  Leo's users have discovered many ways to take advantage of the unification of data and its description.

- Programs may treat nodes as *separate objects*, no matter what data the nodes contain.
  Because nodes are truly separate objects,
  it becomes easy and natural to define new *operations* on those objects,
  **based on the description of those outline found in the node's headline**.

The combination of these features created a chain reaction of creative uses for outlines.
The result has been an explosion of new ideas and capabilities.

Leo supports the following kinds of 'special' nodes:
@test, @suite, @script, @url, @button, @button timer, @rst, @command, etc.
Each of these kinds of nodes defines new objects and new operations on those objects.
The following paragraph show how Leo's users can use these new objects and their operations

Scripting

- The execute script command executes the body text of the presently selected node
  in an environment containing three variables: c, g and p.
  Thus, all scripts have full and *easy* access to all data in the outline containing the script.

- The scripting plugin creates support for script nodes.
  We can treat a node as a script, and *apply that script to any other part of an outline*.
  This is called 'bringing scripts to data'.
  Leo's users can do this using script buttons as follows.
  Any @button node creates a script button in Leo's icon area.
  The name of the button is the node's headline; the script is the node's body text.
  The user can also create new script buttons using the 'Script Button' button.
  Pressing the 'Script Button' button creates a new script button,
  just as if the presently selected node were an @button node.
  Bringing scripts to data is an immensely powerful and useful feature:
  it has eliminated the need for Leo's previous script-find features.

- @command nodes create new minibuffer commands, complete with keyboard shortcuts.
  The headline defines the command name and an optional keyboard shortcut;
  the body text defines the command.

Unit testing

- We can treat a node as an individual unit test,
  and *automatically* create a subclass of UnitTest.TestCase for the script in that node.
  This is Leo's @test node feature.
  Leo will convert the body text of any @test node into a unit tests.

- Similarly, @suite nodes create suites of unit tests using the script in the @suite node.

- A unit test can get test data from any node in the outline in which it resides.
  Thus, outlines can contain not only unit tests, but the data for those tests.

Text formatting

- The rst3 plugin creates support for @rst nodes.
  @rst trees use outline structure to create document structure.
  This is a revolution in organizing documents.
  Full details [ref]

Organizing data

- @url nodes contain references to web addresses, including files on a local disk.
  Double-clicking an @url node opens a web browser on the given URL.

Plugins

- Plugins support many other kinds of user-defined objects and their associated operations.
  Some examples are @view, @read-only, @folder, @produce, @run, @startfile, etc.
  Writing plugins is easy.
  Python makes the programming as easy as possible;
  and Leo provides plugins with easy access to outlines and their data.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218085144.1">The body text of any Leo node may contain a Python script.
The Execute Script commands executes this script in a in an environment,
that predefines three variables: c, g and p.
These variables allow easy access to all the data in the present outline.
For example: the following script prints all the node of the
outline in which the script is embedded::

    for p in c.all_positions():
        indent = ' '*p.level()
        print '%s + %s' % (indent,p.h) # print the node's headline.
        print p.b # print the node's body.

For that matter, scripts can access any data anywhere on your hard drive, or all
the data available on the web, for that matter. You knew that, but this
"innocent" fact will be important later.

**Result 1**:  Leo is a great environment in which to write Python scripts.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218085144.2">Leo's outline can organize any text (or other data for that matter).

**Result 2**:  Leo is a great way to organize standalone scripts.

This seemingly simple result will turn out to have important implications.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218085144.3">As shown in the example above, scripts may get access to the
headline or body text of any node in a Leo outline.  Therefore, scripts may
use the *structure* of the outline to gain access to

a) other scripts,
b) fragments of code for exec or eval or
c) other data.

**Result 3**: Scripts have can treat outline structure as first-class data.

The first "big" reason why the combination of Python &amp; Leo is spectacular.
It gets better...</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218085144.4">The body text of a node is the perfect place data itself (including other
scripts).  The headline of the node is the perfect place to *describe* the
data.  That is, headlines are a natural place for meta-data.  Scripts can
use this meta-data in many creative ways.

**Result 4**: Scripts have easy access to user-definable meta-data.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218085144.5">I first saw the power of results 2, 3 and 4 when creating unit tests for Leo.
Indeed, the body text of a node is the perfect place for putting regression test
data. Headlines describe the data, which is exactly what is needed for
organizing tests. Indeed, I use a script to create regression tests based on the
structure of the outline of the children of the node containing the script (!)

For example, I run the following script to create and run unit tests of
Leo's colorizer::

    import unittest,leoTest
    suite = leoTest.makeColorSuite("colorizerTests","tempNode")
    runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()
    runner.run(suite)

This works as follows:  the arguments to makeColorSuite tell it to look up
the tree for of an ancestor of the present node (the node containing this
script) for a node whose headline is "colorizerTests".  makeColorSuite then
looks for children of *that* node for nodes containing test data.  The node
whose headline is "tempNode" is used by the colorizer during the tests.
Here is the actual code of makeColorSuite::

    def makeColorSuite(testParentHeadline,tempHeadline):
        """Create a colorizer test for every descendant of testParentHeadline."""
        u = testUtils() ; c = top() ; v = c.currentVnode()
        root = u.findRootNode(v)
        temp_v = u.findNodeInTree(root,tempHeadline)
        vList = u.findSubnodesOf(testParentHeadline)
        # Create the suite and add all test cases.
        suite = unittest.makeSuite(unittest.TestCase)
        for v in vList:
            test = colorTestCase(c,v,temp_v)
            suite.addTest(test)
        return suite

The power and simplicity of this code is breathtaking.  All that is required
are two utility routines, findNodeInTree and findSubnodesOf that find
various nodes in an outline based on the outline structure and the headlines
of the nodes:

- findNodeInTree(root,tempHeadline) returns the node in the entire tree
  contain the current node whose headline is tempHeadline.

- u.findSubnodesOf(testParentHeadline) returns a list of all children of the
  node whose name is testParentHeadline.

In short, it is absolutely trivial for a script embedded in a Leo outline to
generate unit tests based on the data in the outline in which the script is
embedded!

Notice, please, what does *not* have to be done:

A. No unit tests are created statically: everything is driven by data (the
   outline itself)

B. No Python test data is created *at all*.   Before I saw this approach, I
   was putting text for the syntax-coloring text in Python strings and passing
   those strings to the regression tests.  Now, the *unchanged* data in the
   body text of nodes becomes the regression test data.

C.  There is no need to mark meta-data as separate from test data: headlines
are naturally distinct from body text.

We see now that Reasons 2, 3 and 4 are a lot more potent than they might
appear at first.  Indeed, Leo plus Python is the ultimate merging of code,
structure and data.   Scripts can use data organized in outlines.  Outlines
organize scripts.  Outlines (particularly their structure) are *data* for
scripts.  Outlines contains metadata for scripts.  Outlines naturally keep
data and meta-data separate.

Please notice, this discussion merely hints at all the games that scripts
could play with outline structure.  Just for example, scripts can easily
insert, delete and reorganize nodes.  And the uses to which outline
structure may be put are practically unlimited, as we shall see later...

Let's turn now to a completely separate topic...</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218085144.6">A few days ago I have added a script-based option to Leo's Find/Change
panel.  For more than 30 years I have been disgusted with tools like regular
expressions.  Calling re powerful is an utter joke; it's way too complex and
way too wimpy.  Script-based find-change is infinitely more powerful.
Instead of containing find text or change *text*, Leo's Find/Change panel
may contains find or change *scripts*.  This becomes possible because scripts
have complete access to both the structure of the outline and all of Leo's
code.

It all works so smoothly:   The find script is responsible for traversing
the tree and for highlighting the found text or otherwise indicating to the
change script what the found text was.  Leo dedicates a Python dict called
app.searchDict for communication between the search script and the change
script.  The change script is responsible for:

-  changing the text, typically by using c.setBodyString(p,newText), and

-  implementing undo, typically by calling c.frame.onBodyChanged(p,"Change",oldText=oldText).

Some details:

- When executing the search and change scripts when the user selects the Find
  All or Change All commands, Leo executes the find or change scripts repeatedly
  only if app.searchDict.get("continue") evaluates to True. Otherwise these
  scripts are only executed once. Otherwise, scripts can use app.searchDict as
  they please.

- For simplicity, most find and change scripts will ignore settings in the Find
  Panel like "whole word", "pattern match", and "reverse": the scripts know what
  to do! However, these settings are available to the scripts via ivars such as
  c.whole_word_flag, etc. if desired.

- Either the find and change scripts may use Python's re module. For example,
  the find script could set app.searchDict["m"] to the match object returned by
  re's match method. The change script would then compute the result, change the
  text and set the undo info as usual.

In effect, Leo's Find/Change panel becomes a new platform for running
scripts interactively.  Leo now has all the find/change capability of
pattern matching languages like Snobol and Icon, using the capabilities of
the plain Python language.  Moreover, Leo can deliver these capabilities
interactively or not depending which buttons you push in Leo's Find/Change
panel.

One last point.  As I mentioned much earlier, there is no reason to confine
the find and change scripts to operate on data only within a Leo outline.
These scripts could as easily traverse your file system as the Leo outline.
But notice: scripts could pull data from the file system into the outline so
that you can see the effects of changes as the scripts operate.  Again, this
can all happen interactively if you like.

No, one more last point.  It's convenient to defined an initScriptFind
utility very similar to the makeColorSuite utility, used like this::

    # Initialize Leo's find panel using the named children of this node.
    from leoGlobals import *
    initScriptFind("Find script","Change script")
    # Start searching at the top.
    top().selectVnode(c.rootVnode())

Put the search script in a child node called "Find script" (no quotes), put
the change script in a child node called "Change script", execute this
script and the following happens:

- The body text of "Find script" node gets put in the find text of Leo's Find/Change dialog.

- The body text of "Change script" node gets put in the find text of Leo's Find/Change dialog.

- The Script Find radio buttons gets selected, as does the Script Change checkbox.

- The root of the outline becomes the selected node.

Presto!  Leo is ready for a script search.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218085144.7">One more feature greatly expands the generality and power of
Leo's outlines combined with Python.  Plugins may now attach arbitrary data
to any node of a Leo outline.  This is done merely by "injecting" an ivar
called  unknownAttributes ivar into Leo's fundamental vnode or tnode objects
(or adding items to the unknownAttributes dict if it already exists).  The
unknownAttributes ivar should be a Python dictionary whose keys are xml
attribute names and whose values are the values of those attributes.

When writing a file, Leo will write "foreign" attributes in the &lt;v&gt; or &lt;t&gt;
xml elements of Leo's .leo file if the corresponding vnode or tnode contains
this unknownAttributes ivar.  Similarly, Leo will create an
unknownAttributes ivar for a vnode or tnode if the corresponding &lt;v&gt; or &lt;t&gt;
element contains an attribute not normally used by Leo.  Leo performs the
standard xml escapes when writing unknown attributes, so plugins can put
*anything* in the unknownAttributes dictionary.  In particular, plugins may
put xml in v.unknownAttributes or t.unknownAttributes.

This means, for example, that plugins may add anything that can be
represented by xml (and that is *everything*) in any node of a Leo outline.
In effect, Leo's file format is now completely extensible.  BTW, plugins can
override any aspect of Leo's behavior, so not only can Leo passively accept
the data in "extended" .leo files, but plugins can extend Leo to *use* this
data!</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218085144.8">All the power of Leo derives directly from the power, flexibility and
dynamism of Python.  But making structure explicit as Leo outlines do adds
an important new dimension, literally and figuratively, to Python.
Moreover, Leo's Find/Change dialog creates a new environment from which to
run Python scripts. At long last the full power of the unification of code
and data is becoming apparent.</t>

This version fixes some minor problems with Leo 4.4a6 and adds autocompletion
and calltips.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
--------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Autocompletion and calltips.  Autocompletion works much like tab completion.

- Dozens of other new features and bug fixes since Leo 4.3.3.

<t tx="ekr.20060227102028.111">Typing a period when @language python is in effect starts autocompletion. Typing
'(' during autocompletion shows the calltip. Typing Return or Control-g
(keyboard-quit) exits autocompletion or calltips.

Autocompletion

Autocompletion shows what may follow a period in code. (Actually you can specify
any character using the auto-complete shortcut setting.) For example, after
typing g. Leo will show a list of all the global functions in leoGlobals.py.
Autocompletion works much like tab completion in the minibuffer. Unlike the
minibuffer, the presently selected completion appears directly in the body
pane.

A leading period brings up 'Autocomplete Modules'. (The period goes away.) You
can also get any module by typing its name. If more than 25 items would appear
in the Autocompleter tab, Leo shows only the valid starting characters. At this
point, typing an exclamation mark shows the complete list. Thereafter, typing
further exclamation marks toggles between full and abbreviated modes.

If x is a list 'x.!' shows all its elements, and if x is a Python dictionary,
'x.!' shows x.keys(). For example, 'sys.modules.!' Again, further exclamation
marks toggles between full and abbreviated modes.

During autocompletion, typing a question mark shows the docstring for the
object. For example: 'g.app?' shows the docstring for g.app. This doesn't work
(yet) directly for Python globals, but '__builtin__.f?' does. Example:
'__builtin__.pow?' shows the docstring for pow.

Autocompletion works in the Find tab; you can use &lt;Tab&gt; to cycle through the
choices. The 'Completion' tab appears while you are doing this; the Find tab
reappears once the completion is finished.

Calltips

Calltips appear after you type an open parenthesis in code. Calltips shows the
expected arguments to a function or method. Calltips work for any Python
function or method, including Python's global function. Examples:

a)  'g.toUnicode('  gives 'g.toUnicode(s, encoding, reportErrors=False'
b) 'c.widgetWantsFocusNow' gives 'c.widgetWantsFocusNow(w'
c) 'reduce(' gives 'reduce(function, sequence[, initial]) -&gt; value'

The calltips appear directly in the text and the argument list is highlighted so
you can just type to replace it. The calltips appear also in the status line for
reference after you have started to replace the args.

Options

Both autocompletion and calltips are initially enabled or disabled by the
enable_autocompleter and enable_calltips settings in leoSettings.leo. You may
enable or disable these features at any time with these commands:
enable-auto-completer-command, enable-calltips-command,
disable-auto-completer-command and disable-calltips-command.</t>

Important: Leo is supposed to convert all characters to unicode, so there should
never be a need for safeStringCompare. The proper way to avoid UnicodeError's is

g.os_path_dirname(self.outputFileName) with self.c.frame.openDirectory. This

This version fixes a long-standing MacOS bug.  It is likely to be the last
beta release before 4.4 final.  This release also adds several new commands
and contains a script for updating leoSettings.leo.

Warning: The previous beta was not widely distributed. Please do some testing in
your environment before recommending this version of Leo to others, (such as
your students).

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
--------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Autocompletion and calltips.  Autocompletion works much like tab completion.

- Dozens of other new features and bug fixes since Leo 4.3.3.

<t tx="ekr.20060417092825.1">See the (presently disabled) script button in scripts.leo at:

Buttons--&gt;@@button updateSettings

From the docstring:

Here is a **preliminary** script that updates a new leoSettings.leo file
(path2) from the settings in a previous leoSettings.leo file (path1).
Presumably, the path2 file is the leoSettings.leo file from a new distribution,
and the path1 file a leoSettings.leo file containing settings that you have
modified.  You must specify the full path of both files in the top-level @button node.

**Warning**: This script modifies the path2 file. Make sure that you don't mind
modifying this file.

**Warning**: This script is unsophisticated in its update algorithm. If if finds
corresponding nodes (node with the same settings name) in both outlines it simply
replaces the node in the path2 file with the node in the path1 file. In
particular, it does not keep track of individual shortcuts: it replaces the body
of one @shortcuts node with the body of the corresponding @shortcuts node.

**Note**: If the path1 file contains a settings node not in the path2 file it
attempts to create a new node in the corresponding place in the path2 file. If
this is not possible, say because the structures of the files are different, the
script places the new node as the last child of the @settings node in the path2
file.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060420094611">The mini-buffer is a text area at the bottom of the body pane.
You use it like the Emacs mini-buffer to invoke commands by their so-called *long name*.
The following commands affect the minibuffer:

- **full-command**: (default shortcut: Alt-x) Puts the focus in the minibuffer. Type a
  full command name, then hit &lt;Return&gt; to execute the command. Tab completion
  works, but not yet for file names.

.. - **quick-command-mode**: (default shortcut: Alt-x) Like Emacs Control-C. This mode is
..   defined in leoSettings.leo. It is useful for commonly-used commands.

- **universal-argument**: (default shortcut: Alt-u) Like Emacs Ctrl-u. Adds a repeat
  count for later command. Ctrl-u 999 a adds 999 a's.

- **keyboard-quit**: (default shortcut: Ctrl-g) Exits any minibuffer mode and puts
  the focus in the body pane.

For example, to print a list of all commands type Alt-X print-commands &lt;Return&gt;.

The following sections list the various commands that you can invoke from the minibuffer.
**Important**: you may bind keystrokes to any of these commands.

<t tx="ekr.20060430220749">The jEdit_ editor drives its syntax colorer using xml **language description files.**
`jEdit's documentation`_ contain a complete description of these xml files.
Each xml file describes one **colorizing mode**.
A mode consists of one or more **rulesets**, and each ruleset consists of a list of **colorizing rules**.
In addition, modes, rulesets and rules may have associated **properties** and **attributes**.
Various rules may specify that the colorizer uses another ruleset (either in the same mode or another mode).

**Important**: jEdit's xml language description files contain no explicit &lt;RULE&gt; elements
Rules are simply sub-elements of an enclosing &lt;RULES&gt; element.
The element indicates the kind of rule that is specified,
for example, &lt;SPAN&gt;, &lt;SEQ&gt;, etc.
By the term **rule element** we shall mean any sub-element of the &lt;RULES&gt; element.

Rather than using the xml language description files directly,
Leo uses Python **colorer control files**,
created automatically from the xml files by a script called jEdit2Py.
These Python files contain all the information in the jEdit's xml files,
so we can (loosely) speak of modes, rulesets, rules, properties and attributes in the Python colorer control files. 
Later sections of this documentation will make this loose correspondence exact.

**Important**: throughout this documentation,
**x.py** will refer to the Python colorer for language x,
and **x.xml** will refer to the corresponding xml language-description file.

Using Python colorer control files has the following advantages:

- Running jEdit2Py need only be done when x.xml changes,
  and the speed of the xml parser in jEdit2Py does not affect the speed of Leo's colorizer in any way.
  Moreover, the jEdit2Py script can contain debugging traces and checks.

- Colorer control files are valid .py files, so all of Python's import optimizations work as usual.
  In particular, all the data in colorer control files is immediately accessible to Leo's colorer.

- Colorer control files are easier for humans to understand and modify than the equivalent xml file.
  Furthermore, it is easy to insert debugging information into Python colorer control files.

- It is easy to modify the Python colorer control files 'by hand' without changing the corresponding xml file.
  In particular, it would be easy to define entirely new kinds of pattern-matching rules in Python merely
  by creating functions in a colorer control file.</t>

Chapter 15: Controlling Syntax Coloring
#########################################

This chapter discusses how to control Leo's new syntax colorer using Python
files derived from jEdit_'s xml language description files. It also discusses
settings related to syntax coloring.

**Important**: this material is for those who want to support Leo's colorizing
code. You do *not* need to understand this chapter in order to use Leo's
colorizers.

The __jEdit_colorizer__.py plugin was an early prototype of the new colorizer.
This code has been retired. The threading_colorizer.py plugin uses a separate
helper thread to do the colorizing. Coding details for this plugin are discussed
in this chapter.

<t tx="ekr.20060502084233">When Leo's syntax colorer sees the '@language x' directive,
it will import x.py from Leo's modes folder.
The colorer can then access any module-level object obj in x.py as x.obj.

Colorizer control files contain **rules functions** corresponding to rule elements in x.xml.
The colorizer can call these functions as if they were members of the colorizer class by
passing 'self' as the first argument of these functions.
I call these rules *functions* to distinguish them from the corresponding
**rules methods** which are actual methods of the colorizer class.
Rules *functions* merely call corresponding rules *methods*.
Indeed, rules functions are simply a way of binding values to keyword arguments of rules methods.
These keywords arguments correspond to the xml attributes of rule elements in x.xml.

The colorizer calls rules functions until one matches, at which point a range of text gets colored and the process repeats.
The inner loop of the colorizer is this code::

    for f in self.rulesDict.get(s[i],[]):
        n = f(self,s,i)
        if n &gt; 0:
            i += n ; break
        else: i += 1

- rulesDict is a dictionary whose keys are rulesets and whose values are ruleset dictionaries.
  Ruleset dictionaries have keys that are single characters and whose values are
  the list of rules that can start with that character. 

- s is the full text to be colorized.

- i is the position within s is to be colorized.

Rules methods (and functions) return n &gt; 0 if they match, and n == 0 if they fail.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502084233.1">The following sections describe the top-level data in x.py.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502090516">**x.properties** is a Python dictionary corresponding to the &lt;PROPS&gt; element in x.xml.
Keys are property names; values are strings, namely the contents of &lt;PROPERTY&gt; elements in x.xml.
x.properties contains properties for the entire mode.
That is, only modes have &lt;PROPS&gt; elements.
For example, here is x.properties in php.py::

    # properties for mode php.xml
    properties = {
        "commentEnd": "--&gt;",
        "commentStart": "&lt;!--",
        "indentCloseBrackets": "}",
        "indentOpenBrackets": "{",
        "lineUpClosingBracket": "true",
    }</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502090516.1">x.py contains a **keyword dictionary** for each ruleset in x.xml.
x.py contains an empty keywords dictionary if a ruleset contains no &lt;KEYWORDS&gt; element.

Keys are strings representing keywords of the language describe by the mode.
Values are strings representing syntactic categories,
i.e. a TYPE attribute valid in x.xml, namely:
COMMENT1, COMMENT2, COMMENT3, COMMENT4,
FUNCTION,
KEYWORD1, KEYWORD2, KEYWORD3, KEYWORD4,
LABEL, LITERAL1, LITERAL2, LITERAL3, LITERAL4,
MARKUP, NULL and OPERATOR.

For example, here (parts of) some keyword dictionaries in php.py::

    # Keywords dict for mode php::PHP
    php_PHP_keywords_dict = {
        "COM_invoke": "keyword2",
        "COM_load": "keyword2",
        "__CLASS__": "keyword3",
        ...
        "abs": "keyword2",
        "abstract": "keyword1",
        "accept_connect": "keyword2",
        ...
    }

    # Keywords dict for mode php::JAVASCRIPT_PHP
    php_JAVASCRIPT_PHP_keywords_dict = {}

    # Keywords dict for mode php::PHPDOC
    php_PHPDOC_keywords_dict = {
        "@abstract": "label",
        "@access": "label",
        "@author": "label",
        ...
        "@var": "label",
        "@version": "label",
    }

x.py also contains **x.keywordsDictDict**.
Keys are ruleset names, values are keywords dictionaries.
Here is keywordsDictDict for php.py::

    # Dictionary of keywords dictionaries for php mode.
    keywordsDictDict = {
        "php_javascript": php_javascript_keywords_dict,
        "php_javascript_php": php_javascript_php_keywords_dict,
        "php_main": php_main_keywords_dict,
        "php_php": php_php_keywords_dict,
        "php_php_literal": php_php_literal_keywords_dict,
        "php_phpdoc": php_phpdoc_keywords_dict,
        "php_tags": php_tags_keywords_dict,
        "php_tags_literal": php_tags_literal_keywords_dict,
    }

The colorizer can get the keywords dictionary for a ruleset as follows::

    keywordsDict = x.keywordsDictDict(rulesetName)

**Note**:
The jEdit2Py script creates 'friendly' names for keyword dictionaries *solely* as an aid for people reading the code.
Leo's colorer uses only the name x.keywordsDictDict;
Leo's colorer never uses the actual names of keywords dictionaries such as php_PHPDOC_keywords_dict.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502090516.2">x.py contains one **rule function** for every rule in every ruleset (&lt;RULES&gt; element) in x.xml.
These rules have names rule1 through  ruleN,
where N is the total number of rules in all rulesets in x.xml.

Each rules *function* merely calls a rules *method* in Leo's colorizer.
Which method gets called depends on the corresponding element in `x.xml`.
For example, the first rule in php.xml is::

    &lt;SPAN TYPE="MARKUP" DELEGATE="PHP"&gt;
		&lt;BEGIN&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/BEGIN&gt;
		&lt;END&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/END&gt;
	&lt;/SPAN&gt;

and the corresponding rule function is::

    def php_rule0(colorer, s, i):
        return colorer.match_span(s, i, kind="markup", begin="&lt;?php", end="?&gt;",
            at_line_start=False, at_whitespace_end=False, at_word_start=False,
            delegate="PHP",exclude_match=False,
            no_escape=False, no_line_break=False, no_word_break=False)


php_rule0 calls colorer.match_span because the corresponding xml rule is a &lt;SPAN&gt; element.

For each ruleset, x.py also contains a **rules dictionary**,
a Python dictionary whose keys are characters and whose values are all lists
of rules functions that that can match the key.
For example::

    # Rules dict for phpdoc ruleset.
    rulesDict8 = {
        "*": [rule64,],
        "0": [rule70,],
        "1": [rule70,],
        "2": [rule70,],
        "3": [rule70,],
        "4": [rule70,],
        "5": [rule70,],
        "6": [rule70,],
        "7": [rule70,],
        "8": [rule70,],
        "9": [rule70,],
        "&lt;": [rule65,rule66,rule67,rule68,rule69,],
        "@": [rule70,],
        "A": [rule70,],

        "y": [rule70,],
        "z": [rule70,],
        "{": [rule63,],
    }

**Note**: The order of rules in each rules list is important;
it should be the same as rules element in x.xml.

Finally, x.py contains **x.rulesDictDict**.
Keys are ruleset names, values are rules dictionaries.
The colorer can get the rules list for character ch as follows::

    self.rulesDict = x.rulesDictDict.get(rulesetName) # When a mode is inited.
    ...
    rules = self.rulesDict.get(ch,[]) # In the main loop.

For example, here is the rules dictionary for php.py::

    # x.rulesDictDict for php mode.
    rulesDictDict = {
        "php_javascript": rulesDict6,
        "php_javascript_php": rulesDict7,
        "php_main": rulesDict1,
        "php_php": rulesDict4,
        "php_php_literal": rulesDict5,
        "php_phpdoc": rulesDict8,
        "php_tags": rulesDict2,
        "php_tags_literal": rulesDict3,
    }

**Note**:
The jEdit2Py script creates 'friendly' names for rules lists *solely* as an aid for people reading the code.
Leo's colorer uses only the name x.rulesDictDict;
Leo's colorer never uses the actual names of rules lists such as rulesDict8,
and Leo's colorer never uses the actual names of rules functions such as rule64.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502100550">A **ruleset name** is a Python string having the form 'x_setname',
where setname is the value of the SET attribute of the &lt;RULES&gt; element in x.xml.
For example, the ruleset name of the ruleset whose SET attribute is JAVASCRIPT in php.xml is
'php_JAVASCRIPT'.
**Important**: by convention, the ruleset name of the default &lt;RULES&gt; element is 'x_main';
note that default &lt;RULES&gt; element have no SET attributes.

The colorizer uses ruleset names to gain access to all data structures in x.py.
To anticipate a bit, ruleset names are keys into two standard dictionaries,
x.rulesDict and x.keywordsDictDict,
from which the colorizer can get all other information in x.py::

    # The rules list for the 'JAVASCRIPT' ruleset in php.xml.
    rules = x.rulesDict('php_JAVASCRIPT')

    # The keywords dict for the 'JAVASCRIPT' ruleset in php.xml.
    keywordsDict = x.keywordsDictDict('php_JAVASCRIPT')

In fact, ruleset names (and x.rulesDict and x.keywordsDictDict)
are the **only** names that the colorizer needs to know in order to access all information in x.py.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502122950">This section describes each rules method in Leo's new colorizer.
Rules methods are called by rules functions in colorizer control file;
they correspond directly to rules elements in jEdit's language description files.
In fact, this documentation is a 'refactoring' of `jEdit's documentation`_.

All rule methods attempt to match a pattern at a particular spot in a string.
These methods all return True if the match succeeds.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20060503064515">All rule methods take three required arguments and zero or more optional keyword arguments.

Here is a list of the required arguments and their meaning:

- **self**: An instance of Leo's colorizer.

- **s**: The string in which matches may be found.

- **i**: The location within the string at which the rule method looks for a match.

Here is a list of all optional keyword arguments and their meaning:

- **at_line_start**:
  If True, a match will succeed only if i is at the start of a line.

- **at_whitespace_end**:
  If True, the match will succeed only if i is at the first non-whitespace text in a line.

- **at_word_start**:
  If True, the match will succeed only if i is at the beginning of a word.

- **delegate**:
  If non-empty, the value of this argument is a `ruleset name`_.
  If the match succeeds, the matched text will be colored recursively with the indicate ruleset.

- **exclude_match**:
  If True, the actual text that matched will not be colored.
  The meaning of this argument varies slightly depending on whether one or two sequences are matched.
  See the individual rule methods for details.

- **kind**: A string representing a class of tokens, i.e., one of:
  'comment1', 'comment2', 'comment3', 'comment4', 'function',
  'keyword1', 'keyword2', 'keyword3', 'keyword4',
  'label', 'literal1', 'literal2', 'literal3', 'literal4',
  'markup', 'null' and 'operator'.

- **no_escape**:
  If True, the ruleset's escape character will have no effect before the end argument to match_span.
  Otherwise, the presence of the escape character will cause that occurrence of the end string to be ignored.

- **no_line_break**:
  If True, the match will not succeed across line breaks.

- **no_word_break**:
  If True, the match will not cross word breaks.

New in Leo 4.4.1 final: the regular expression rule matchers no longer get a hash_char argument
because such matchers are called only if the present search pattern starts with hash_char.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060503072213">x.importDict is a Python dictionary.
Keys are ruleset names; values are a list of ruleset names.
For example::

    # Import dict for php mode.
    importDict = {
        "php_javascript_php": ["javascript::main"],
    }

For any ruleset R whose ruleset name is N, x.importDict.get(N)
is the list of rulesets names whose rulesets appear in
a DELEGATE attribute of an &lt;IMPORT&gt; rule element in R's ruleset.
Such **imported** ruleset are copied to the end of the R's rules list.
Leo's colorizer does this copying only once, when loading ruleset R for the first time.

**Note 1**: Loading imported rulesets must be done at 'run time'.
It should definitely not be done by jEdit2Py at 'compile time';
that would require running jEdit2Py on *all* .xml files whenever any such file changed.

**Note 2**:  Multiple &lt;IMPORT&gt; rule elements in a single ruleset are allowed:
delegated rules are copied to the end of N's rules list in the order they appear in the ruleset.

**Note 3**: The DELEGATE attribute of &lt;IMPORT&gt; elements is, in fact,
completely separate from the DELEGATE attributes of other rules as
discussed in `Arguments to rule methods`_.
Indeed, the DELEGATE attribute of &lt;IMPORT&gt; elements creates entries in
x.importDict, which in turn causes the colorizer to append the rules of the imported ruleset
to the end of the present rules list.
In contrast, the DELEGATE attributes of other rules sets the delegate argument to rules methods,
which in tern causes the colorizer to recursively color the matched text with the **delegated** ruleset.
In short:

- The rules of **imported** rulesets are appended to the end of another rules list;
  the rules of **delegated** rulesets never are.

- **Imported** ruleset names appear as the values of items in x.importDict;
  **delegated** ruleset names appear as delegate arguments to rule methods.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060510085547">x.py contains a **attribute dictionary** for each ruleset in x.xml.
Keys are attribute names, values strings representing the values of the attributes.
This dictionary is empty if a ruleset contains no attributes.
The valid keys are:

- 'default': the default token type.  'null' is the default.

- 'digit_re': a regular expression.
  Words matching this regular expression are colored with the digit token type.

- 'ignore_case': 'true' or 'false'.  Default is 'true'.

- 'highlight_digits': 'true' or 'false'.  Default is 'true'.

- 'no_word_sep': A list of characters treated as 'alphabetic' characters when matching keywords.

For example, here is one attribute dictionary in php.py::

    # Attributes dict for php_javascript ruleset.
    php_javascript_attributes_dict = {
        "default": "MARKUP",
        "digit_re": "",
        "highlight_digits": "true",
        "ignore_case": "true",
        "no_word_sep": "",
    }

x.py also contains **x.attributesDictDict**.
Keys are ruleset names, values are attribute dictionaries.
Here is attributesDictDict for php.py::

    # Dictionary of attributes dictionaries for php mode.
    attributesDictDict = {
        "php_javascript": php_javascript_attributes_dict,
        "php_javascript_php": php_javascript_php_attributes_dict,
        "php_main": php_main_attributes_dict,
        "php_php": php_php_attributes_dict,
        "php_php_literal": php_php_literal_attributes_dict,
        "php_phpdoc": php_phpdoc_attributes_dict,
        "php_tags": php_tags_attributes_dict,
        "php_tags_literal": php_tags_literal_attributes_dict,
    }

**Note**:
The jEdit2Py script creates 'friendly' names for attribute dictionaries *solely* as an aid for people reading the code.
Leo's colorer uses only the name x.attributeDictDict;
Leo's colorer never uses the actual names of attribute dictionaries.</t>

Leo 4.4 Final is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
--------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Autocompletion and calltips.  Autocompletion works much like tab completion.
  To enable autocompletion, bind a key to the auto-complete command.

- Dozens of other new features and bug fixes since Leo 4.3.3.

<t tx="ekr.20060527103630">A new method has been added to make it more easily to write rST code from scripts::

    c.rstCommands.writeNodeToString(p)

writeNodeToString scans p's tree (p defaults to presently selected node) looking for @rst nodes.
When the first @rst node is found, writeNodeToString processes the node as usual, with the following changes:

- @rst need not be followed by a filename; any filename and its extension are *ignored*.

- Only the ext argument to writeNodeToString determines the type of output produced.
  The valid values for the ext argument are None (for rst output), '.html', '.pdf', and '.tex'.

- Instead of writing the result to a file, writeNodeToString returns the tuple (p,s),
  where p is the node whose tree produced the output, and s is the output itself.

- writeNodeToString returns after processing at most one @rst node.

Scripts can easily use writeNodeToString to convert @rst trees into various kinds of output.
For example::

    p,s = c.rstCommands.writeNodeToString(p,ext='html')

Notes:

- This script scans the presently selected tree for @rst nodes.
  In particular, if the presently selected tree does not contain an @rst node the search continues in parent trees.
  When an @rst node is found, it converts the node (and descendants) to html and returns p,
  the found @rst node and s, the html itself.
  
- Valid values for the ext argument are ".html", ".tex" or None (specifies rst output)

- There is some support for ext=".pdf", but this is experimental code.  Expect crashes.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20060527112801">The following settings in leoSettings.leo control debugger operation.
The settings shown here will be assumed to be in effect throughout this chapter.

@string debugger_kind = winpdb

This setting controls what debugger the 'Debug Script' script button uses.
Eventually this setting will control what debugger the debug command uses.
At present the only valid value is 'winpdb'

@bool write_script_file = True

True: The execute script command writes the script to be executed to a file,
then executes the script using Python's execFile function. The script_file_path
setting specifies the path to this file. False (legacy): The execute script
command uses Python's exec command to execute the script.

@string script_file_path = ../test/scriptFile.py

The path to the file to be written by the execute-script command. Notes:

- This setting has effect only if the write_script_file setting is True.
- Use / as the path delimiter, regardless of platform.
- The default path is ../test/scriptFile.py if no path is given.
- The path starts at g.app.loadDir, so for example ../test/scriptFile.py is equivalent to leo/test/scriptFile.py.
- The filename should end in .py.

@string debugger_path = None

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060529053407">@ignore can only be used in the root node of @thin trees.  It tells Leo to ignore the tree.

The @ignore directive can not be used elsewhere in @thin trees because of the way Leo recreates 
outlines from external files. This is an absolutely crucial restriction and will never go away.
For a few more details, see `Leo 4.0: Eliminating error 'recovery'`_ in `Chapter 9: History of Leo`_.

There are several workaround, as shown in LeoPy.leo:

- keep notes in the outline outside of any external file.

- Use @all to gather notes in a external file, as in done in @thin leoProjects.txt.</t>

http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.1:
----------------------------
- A new colorizer plugin controlled by jEdit language description files.
  At present this plugin only reliably colors @language python code.
- Multiple editors in Leo's body pane.
- Search commands now support regex replace patterns: \1, \2, etc.
- Support for external debuggers: see http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/debuggers.html
- The scripting plugin now creates a Debug Script button.
- Several new commands including run-unit-test, python-help and toggle-invisibles.
- The help-for-command commands now contains information for almost all commands.
- A new shortcut_button plugin.

<t tx="ekr.20060602142732">

leoKeys.py handles key bindings.
There are two kinds of bindings, gui bindings and pane bindings.

**Gui bindings** are the actual binding as seen by Tkinter (or whatever gui is in effect).
Leo binds every key that has a binding to k.masterKeyHander.
For Tkinter, a *separate* binding must be made, rather than a single &lt;Key&gt; binding,
because, alas, Tkinter key events provide insufficient enough information
to tell what key actually caused the key event(!)
This is a significant hole in Tkinter's event mechanism.

At present Leo makes gui bindings in several places, all equivalent.
Bindings are made to callbacks, all of which have this form::

     def callback(event=None,k=k,stroke=stroke):
        return k.masterKeyHandler(event,stroke)

As a result, changing gui bindings actually has no effect whatever.
It would be clearer to have a single place to make these bindings...

In any case, the purpose of these callbacks is to capture the value of 'stroke' so
that it can be passed to k.masterKeyHandler.
This relieves k.masterKeyHandler of the impossible task of computing the stroke from the event.
**Important**:  No function argument is ever passed to k.masterKeyHandler from these callbacks,
because k.masterKeyHandler binds keys to command handlers as described next.

**Pane bindings** are bindings represented by various Python dictionaries in the keyHandlerClass
(see below).
k.masterKeyHandler and its helpers use these dictionaries to call the proper command or mode handler.
This logic is hairy, but it is completely separate from the gui binding logic.

Here are the dictionaries that k.masterKeyHandler uses:

- c.commandsDict:
  Keys are minibuffer command names; values are functions f.

- k.inverseCommandsDict:
  Keys are f.__name__l values are emacs command names.

- k.bindingsDict:
  Keys are shortcuts; values are *lists* of g.bunch(func,name,warningGiven).

- k.masterBindingsDict:
  Keys are pane names: 'all','text',etc. or mode names.
  Values are dicts:  keys are strokes; values are g.Bunch(commandName,func,pane,stroke).

- k.modeWidgetsDict:
  Keys are mode names; values are lists of widgets to which bindings have been made.

- k.settingsNameDict:
  Keys are lowercase settings; values are 'real' Tk key specifiers.
  Important: this table has no inverse.

- inverseBindingDict:
  This is *not* an ivar; it is computed by k.computeInverseBindingDict().
  Keys are emacs command names; values are *lists* of shortcuts.</t>

There were actually two bugs:
    
- parseLeoSentinel was not recognizing the closing comment delim (!!)

- putDirective was incorrectly setting delims for @language and @comment delims.
  This is wrong: the init code calls scanAllDirectives, and the comment delims
  **must not change** in the file (except as the result of @delims.)</t>

<t tx="ekr.20060613062025.1">These commands are for debugging Leo itself::

<t tx="ekr.20060613062025.10">These commands put Leo into various kinds of modes.

- The enter-x-mode commands enter modes defined by \@mode nodes in leoSettings.leo
  (or in other .leo files).

- The set-command-state, set-insert-state, set-overwrite-state commands
  determine how treats unbound plain keys. Leo ignores such keys in command
  state, inserts them into the body pane in insert state, and overwrites the
  character at the cursor position in overwrite state.

- Other commands determine whether autocompletion or calltips are in effect.

- When extend mode is effect, basic editing commands that move the cursor also
  extend the selected text.
  For example, in extend mode the back-char command works the same as the
  back-char-extend-selection command.

Here is the full list of mode-related commands::

    auto-complete
    auto-complete-force
    disable-autocompleter
    disable-calltips
    enable-autocompleter

What's New in Leo 4.4
##########################################

This page summarizes the changes made in Leo 4.4.
For full details see the release notes section in LeoDocs.leo.

The main features of Leo 4.4 are:

- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
  name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
  and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
  regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
  Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
  dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
  create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Autocompletion and calltips.  Autocompletion works much like tab completion.
  To enable autocompletion, bind a key to the auto-complete command.

Leo 4.4.1 beta 2 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.1:
----------------------------
- A new colorizer plugin controlled by jEdit language description files.
  At present this plugin only reliably colors @language python code.
- Multiple editors in Leo's body pane.
- Search commands now support regex replace patterns: \1, \2, etc.
- Support for external debuggers: see http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/debuggers.html
- The scripting plugin now creates a Debug Script button.
- Several new commands including run-unit-test, python-help and toggle-invisibles.
- The help-for-command commands now contains information for almost all commands.
- A new shortcut_button plugin.

<t tx="ekr.20060620094645.106"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20060620094645.107">Leo now supports bindings of the form:

command-name !command = shortcut

You will find examples in leoSettings.leo in the node

@keys EKR bindings: vim mode bindings--&gt;Shortcuts--&gt;@shortcuts top-level keys

Such bindings are essential for all plain key bindings that are *only* to be executed in command mode.  Most, but *not* all plain key bindings should be bound in the !command 'pane'.  The two exceptions presently are '.' which *always* invokes the autocompleter code and '(' which *always* invokes the calltips code.

It is now possible to have a *single* set of key bindings be 'Emacs-like' and
'Vim-like' at the same time. See the node EKR bindings: vim mode bindings in
leoSettings.leo.

One setting switches between emacs-like operation and vim-like operation:

For emacs, use:
@strings  [ignore,insert,overwrite] top_level_unbound_key_action = insert

For vim, use:
@strings  [ignore,insert,overwrite] top_level_unbound_key_action = ignore

Vim-like modes are made possible by two new features:

1. Entry commands in @mode nodes. In the body of @mode nodes, lines of the form

--&gt; command-name

tell Leo to execute the command when entering the mode. More than one such lines
may exist; Leo executes them in the order they appear. Entry commands are
potentially a very powerful feature. To avoid chaos, entry commands should not
alter the minibuffer :-)

2. Silent modes. In order to keep the selected text visible, Leo must *not* move
focus into the minibuffer for editing commands. The set-silent-mode command
tells Leo to treat the mode described in the @mode node as a silent mode. A true
mode is created, but it only affects key bindings and the minibuffer never
becomes active.

Thus, all @mode nodes for vim-like modes contain the following line:

--&gt; set-silent-mode.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060620094645.108">All sets of key bindings in leoSettings.leo now start with @keys in the headline
of the root node. The @keys convention is used *only* by the Check Bindings
script. So now, instead of having a static list of key bindings sets (which is
guaranteed to get out-of-date), the Check Bindings script can scan all of
leoSettings.leo for sets of key bindings.

Another improvement to the Check Bindings script. Besides doing a better job of
checking, you may now specify optional commands, such as commands defined in
plugins. The Check Bindings will not complain if the commands don't presently
exists in k.commandsDict. You specify such commands by adding items to the
following lists in the root node of the Check Bindings script, i.e., the node
Buttons--&gt;@button Check Bindings.

optionalCommandPrefixes = ['group-operations']
optionalCommandNames = []</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060620094645.109">- added isearch-with-present-options.
- many small improvements to isearch code.
- regex searches now highlighted properly.
- isearches are (and should be) confined to a single body text.
- Backspace now handled properly.

A small glitch. Starting a regexp pattern with '.' will cause the entire pattern
to turn red initially, which is technically correct but perhaps a bit
confusing.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20060620094645.225"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20060620094645.231">The commands that enable and disable calltips now update the status line.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060620094645.232">Creating a script button creates the press-xxx-button command,
and you can specify settings for such commands using @shortcuts nodes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060620094645.233"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20060620094645.234">@nocolor

The scripting plugin now creates a press-x-button command for each scripting button named x.
You can bind shortcuts to such commands by placing @shortcuts nodes in an @setting tree in the outline containing the @button nodes.  test.leo shows an example.

What I did:
    
- The scripting plugin now defines button bindings with the 'button' pane specifier.
  This takes precedence over all other specifiers.

- k.bindKeyToDict now does a better job of detecting and warning about redefinitions.

- k.printBindings now properly sorts entries.
  This was causing me a great deal of confusion.

- k.registerCommand now properly gets shortcuts from settings if possible,
  and makes bindings in the new 'button' pane specifier.

- masterKeyHandlerHelper now supports the 'button' pane specifier,
  which overrides all others.

Maybe put a link to the html TOC into the Help Menu,
"%leodir%/doc/html/leo_TOC.html".

This is more intuitive (to newbies) than the LeoDocs.leo link.  I found this
very confusing in the beginning.

What I did:

In Doc_Only_Mode the rst3 plugin outputs headlines irrespective of the show_headlines
setting.  The other modes do honor this setting.

I scratched around and managed to fix this by changing the node: rst3.py--&gt;class
rstClass--&gt;write methods--&gt;writeBody &amp; helpers--&gt;handleDocOnlyMode

In Line 25 I added a new statement:
     if showHeadlines:
and indented the following 3 lines to make them conditional on this if:
        if result or showThisHeadline or showOrganizers or p == self.topNode:
            # g.trace(len(result),p.headString())

I have a @url node pointing to a Leo file which has a filename with %20 in it.
When I double-click this node I get:

"can not open: \\\Documents%20and%20Settings\tftcj1.EDCON\My%20Documents\Proj\RI
CAA\PcasCellLink.leo"

Taking a look with a debugger, I see that Plugins--&gt;Enhancing the icon and status
areas--&gt;@thin UNL.py--&gt;onUrl1 line 29ish does not covert %20 to spaces before
calling openWithFileName.</t>

I am looking at the image plugin for organizing photos, and discovered that
it is limited to gif files only.  I found this a bit silly as installing the
ImageTk module from the Python Imaging Library and making a two line change
to the plugin enables it to be used on practically any image type.

The two line are:
1.  a new import:-
import ImageTk

2. In &lt;&lt;select image&gt;&gt; line 9 change 
photo = Tk.PhotoImage(master=a.root, file=filename)

to

photo = ImageTk.PhotoImage(master=a.root, file=filename)</t>

<t tx="ekr.20060621075135">This section provides step-by-step instructions for turning a script button into a plugin.
The plugin will define a minibuffer command that does the same thing as pressing the button.

We shall start with a script button whose script is::

    g.es_print('c: %s' % (c.fileName()),color='red')
    g.es_print('p: %s' % (p.h),color='red')

Not very exciting, but it uses the predefined c and p constants.
Our plugin will create a minibuffer command called print-cp.

Here are the step-by-step instructions:

1. Open leoPlugins.leo and use the Copy Node command to copy the tree at:

Plugins--&gt; Templates: these show recommended ways of defining plugins.--&gt;Template for Tk plugin with per-commander controller class

2. Paste the tree somewhere else and rename it to @thin print_cp.py.
   I copied the tree to::

    Plugins--&gt;Example code--&gt;@thin print_cp.py

3. Update the docstring, the __version__ constant and the &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt; section.
   Note that unlike when using script buttons, you must have the following imports::

    import leo.core.leoGlobals as g
    import leo.core.leoPlugins as leoPlugins

4. Because this plugin doesn't require any gui interface, we simplify the init function::

    def init ():
        leoPlugins.registerHandler('after-create-leo-frame',onCreate)
        return True

   The init function registers the onCreate hook and
   returns True to indicate that it loaded properly.

5. Leave the onCreate function unchanged.
   It creates a per-commander instance of the pluginController class.
   This class exists mainly to bind self.c properly to a commander.

6. Change the constructor (__init__ method) of the pluginController class to this::

    def __init__ (self,c):
        self.c = c
        c.k.registerCommand('print-cp',shortcut=None,func=self.print_cp)
        script = "c.k.simulateCommand('print-cp')"
        g.app.gui.makeScriptButton(c,script=script,buttonText='Print c &amp; p',bg='red')

   This registers the print_cp *method* of the pluginController class as the print-cp minibuffer command,
   and creates a script button with the following script::

       c.k.simulateCommand('print-cp')

7. Define the print_cp method as follows::

    def print_cp (self,event=None):
        c = self.c ; p = c.p
        g.es_print('c: %s' % (c.fileName()),color='red')
        g.es_print('p: %s' % (p.h),color='red')

   The print_cp method must have the event argument as shown because it implements a minibuffer command.
   The print_cp method gets the proper commander from the c ivar (instance variable) and computes
   the current position p as shown.

8. Enable the print_cp plugin by putting the following in an @enabled-plugins node::

    print_cp.py

9. Test the plugin by restarting Leo (I just start test.leo).
   You can test the plugin by pressing the 'Print c&amp;p' button
   or by typing &lt;Alt-x&gt; print-cp &lt;Return&gt;.

That's all.  You can find the completed version of the print_cp plugin in leoPlugins.leo,
or leoPluginsRef.leo if you are using cvs.</t>

Leo 4.4.1 beta 3 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.1:
----------------------------
- A new colorizer plugin controlled by jEdit language description files.
  At present this plugin only reliably colors @language python code.
- Multiple editors in Leo's body pane.
- Search commands now support regex replace patterns: \1, \2, etc.
- Support for external debuggers: see http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/debuggers.html
- The scripting plugin now creates a Debug Script button.
- Several new commands including run-unit-test, python-help and toggle-invisibles.
- The help-for-command commands now contains information for almost all commands.
- A new shortcut_button plugin.

<t tx="ekr.20060629083935">Leo 4.4 was a year-long effort to incorporate an Emacs-style minibuffer and
related commands into Leo. Thinking in terms of minibuffer commands frees my
thinking. Leo 4.4 also featured many improvements in how keys are bound to
commands, including per-pane bindings and user-defined key-binding modes.

Development on long-delayed projects accelerated after 4.4 final went out the door.
Recent projects include:

- Controlling syntax coloring with jEdit's xml language-description files.
  See Chapter 15.
- Support for debugging scripts using external debuggers.
  See Chapter 16.
- Modifying Leo's vnodes and tnodes so that Leo's data can be used with ZODB.
  See Chapter 17.
- Using pymacs to write Leo scripts within Emacs.
  See Chapter 18.
- Using the leoBridge module to embed Leo support in other programs.

There is no direct way to make script buttons available in multiple Leo files.
Sure, you could copy and paste the @button nodes, but there is a slightly
easier way using the "New Buttons" plugin.

1) Create and test and debug your desired Script Button.

2) With the Script Button node selected, run Plugins --&gt; New buttons --&gt; Make Template From

Open a new Leo file.

3) Assuming you have only the one New Button Template defined, left-click the
   New button, and a new node will be added to your outline. (Otherwise, you'll
   need to select the Template you want.)

4) Press [Script Button] to create the new script button.

It's easier to *do* this than to *explain* it!</t>

OK, I found out how to duplicate this one.  This caused me a lot of grief until
I found out what is causing it.

NodeA:
...Child1
...Child2
...Child3

NodeB:
...CloneChild1
...CloneChild2
...CloneChild3

Now, put cursor on NodaA.  Ctrl-Shift-C (copy node).
Next, put cursor on CloneChild3.  Paste Node as Clone
You should get an invalid paste clone message.

Now, first cursor move (for me) puts NodeB as top node, ERASING all other nodes.
Warning:  DO NOT SAVE NOW.  It will erase all other nodes.

I have a tree of some 2500 nodes, run a script that marks
probably 1500-2000 of them, and that's quick (2-3 seconds max.).

I can clear all the marks with:

for p in c.all_positions():
    p.v.clearMarked()

and that also is quick (2-3 seconds max.).  But when I use the menu option Unmark
All, that takes forever (1-2 minutes :-) running 100% CPU all the while.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060830142929">This section discusses only those settings that affect syntax coloring.
See `Chapter 8`_ for a general discussion of Leo's settings.

Both the old colorizer (in Leo's core) and the new colorizer (the threading_colorizer plugin)
now support @font settings for colorizing options.
The settings for the old colorizer are::

    comment_font, cweb_section_name_font, directive_font,
    doc_part_font, keyword_font, leo_keyword_font, section_name_font,
    section_name_brackets_font, string_font, undefined_section_name_font,
    latexBackground_font, and latex_background_font.

The settings for the new colorizer are all of the above (except keyword_font) plus the following::

    comment1, comment2_font, comment3_font, comment4_font, function_font,
    keyword1_font, keyword2_font, keyword3_font, keyword4_font, label_font,
    literal1_font, literal2_font, literal3_font, literal4_font, markup_font,
    null_font, and operator_font.

To specify a font, say for keyword_font, to be used as the default font for **all** languages,
put the following in the body text of an @font node in leoSettings.leo::

    # keyword_font_family = None
    keyword_font_size = 16
    keyword_font_slant = roman
        # roman, italic
    keyword_font_weight = bold
        # normal, bold

Comments are allowed and undefined settings are set to reasonable defaults. 
At present, comments can not follow a setting: comments must start a line.

You can specify per-language settings by preceding the settings names by a prefix x.
Such settings affect only colorizing for language x (i.e., all the modes in modes/x.py when using the new colorizer).
For example, to specify a font for php (only), put the following in the body text of an @font node in leoSettings.leo::

    # php_keyword_font_family = None
    php_keyword_font_size = 16
    php_keyword_font_slant = roman
        # roman, italic
    php_keyword_font_weight = bold
        # normal, bold</t>

Chapter 17: Using ZODB with Leo
#######################################

This chapter discusses how to write Leo scripts that store and retrieve data using ZODB_.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913165542.1"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913165542.2">This function inits the zodb.
pathToZodbStorage is the full path to the zodb storage file.
You can call g.init_zodb as many times as you like.
Only the first call for any path actually does anything:
subsequent calls for a previously opened path simply return the same value as the first call.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913165542.3">This vnode method returns v2, a copy of v that is completely detached from the
outline. v2.fileIndex is unrelated to v.fileIndex initially, but is may be
convenient to copy this field::

    v2 = v.detach()
    v2.fileIndex = v.fileIndex</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913170145">To enable zodb scripting within Leo, you must set use_zodb = True in the root node of leoNodes.py.
You must also install ZODB itself.  See `Installing ZODB`_ for details.

When ZODB is installed and use_zodb is True
Leo's vnode and tnode classes become subclasses of ZODB.Persistence.Persistent.
This is all that is needed to save/retrieve vnodes or tnodes to/from the ZODB.

**Important notes**:

- Scripts **should not** store or retrieve positions using the ZODB!
  Doing so makes sense neither from Leo's point of view nor from ZODB's point of view.

- The examples below show how to store or retrieve Leo data by accessing
  the so-called root of a ZODB connection.
  However, these are only examples.
  Scripts are free to do with Leo's vnodes and tnodes *anything* that can
  be done with ZODB.Persistence.Persistent objects.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913170403">Scripts should call g.init_zodb to open a ZODB.Storage file.
g.init_zodb returns an instance of ZODB.DB.  For example::

    db = g.init_zodb (zodbStorageFileName)

You can call g.init_zodb as many times as you like.
Only the first call for any path actually does anything:
subsequent calls for a previously opened path simply return the same value as the first call.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913170403.1">The following script writes v, a tree of vnodes, to zodb::

    db = g.init_zodb (zodbStorageFileName)
    connection = db.open()
    try:
        root = connection.root()
        root[aKey] = v # See next section for how to define aKey.
    finally:
        get_transaction().commit()
        connection.close()

Notes:

- v must be a vnode (or a tnode).
  Scripts should *not* attempt to store Leo positions in the zodb.
  v can be the root of an entire outline or a subtree.
  For example, either of the following would be reasonable::

    root[aKey] = c.rootPosition().v
    root[aKey] = c.p.v

- To write a single vnode without writing any of its children you can use v.detach.
  For example::

    root[aKey] = v.detach()

- **Important**: It is simplest if only one zodb connection is open at any one time,
  so scripts would typically close the zodb connection immediately after processing the data.
  The correct way to do this is in a finally statement, as shown above.

- The script above does not define aKey.
  The following section discusses how to define reasonable zodb keys.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913170403.2">The following script reads a tree of vnodes from zodb and sets p as the root position of the tree::

    try:
        connection = db.open()
        root = connection.root()
        v = root.get(aKey)
        p = leoNodes.position(v)
    finally:
        get_transaction().commit()
        connection.close()

<t tx="ekr.20060913175437">The keys used to store and retrieve data in connection.root() can be any string that uniquely identifies the data.
The following are only suggestions: you are free to use any string you like.

1. When saving a file, you would probably use a key that is similar to a real file path.
   For example::

        aKey = c.fileName()

2. When saving a single vnode or tree of vnodes, say v,
   a good choice would be to use v's gnx, namely::

        aKey = g.app.nodeIndices.toString(v.fileIndex)

   Note that v.detach() does not automatically copy v.fileIndex to the detached node,
   so when writing a detached node you would typically do the following::

       v2 = v.detach()
       v2.fileIndex = v.fileIndex
       aKey = g.app.nodeIndices.toString(v2.fileIndex)</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913175437.1">The scripts shown above close the zodb connection after processing the data.
This is by far the simplest strategy.
I recommend it for typical scripts.

**Important**: you must **leave the connection open** if your script modifies persistent data in any way.
(Actually, this statement is not really true,
but you must define zodb transaction managers if you intend to use multiple connections simultaneously.
This complication is beyond the scope of this documentation.)
For example, it would be possible to create a new Leo outline from the data just read,
but the script must leave the connection open.
I do not recommend this tactic, but for the adventurous here is some sample code::

    connection = self.db.open()
    root = connection.root()
    v = root.get(fileName)
    if v:
        c2 = c.new()
        c2.openDirectory = c.openDirectory # A hack.
        c2.mFileName = fileName # Another hack.
        c2.beginUpdate()
        try:
            c2.setRootVnode(v)
            c2Root = c2.rootPosition()
            c2.atFileCommands.readAll(c2Root)
            g.es_print('zodb read: %s' % (fileName))
        finally:
            c2.endUpdate()
        # Do *not* close the connection while the new Leo window is open!
    else:
        g.es_print('zodb read: not found: %s' % (fileName))


This will work **provided** that no other zodb connection is ever opened while this connection is opened.
Unless special zodb precautions are taken (like defining zodb transaction managers)
calling get_transaction().commit() will affect **all** open connections.
You have been warned.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060915112109">Find the @thin leoApp.py node in leoPy.leo.
In the ctor for the LeoApp class set self.use_psyco to True or False.
You will find this ctor in the node::

    Code--&gt;Core classes...--&gt;@thin leoApp.py--&gt;app.__init__

Note that this ivar can not be set using settings in leoSettings.leo because
Leo uses g.app.use_psyco before processing configuration settings.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060917130130">Add the following to the start of your scripts::

    @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

Without this line, constructs such as::

    u = u'a-(2 unicode characters here)-z'
    u = 'a-(2 unicode characters here)-z'

will not work when executed with Leo's execute script command.
Indeed, the Execute Script command creates the script by writing the tree
containing the script to a string. This is done using Leo's write logic, and
this logic converts the unicode input to a utf-8 encoded string. So *all
non-ascii characters* get converted to their equivalent in the utf-8 encoding. 
Call these encoding &lt;e1&gt; and &lt;e2&gt;. In effect the script becomes::

    u = u'a-&lt;e1&gt;-&lt;e2&gt;-z'
    u = 'a-&lt;e2&gt;-&lt;e&gt;-z'

which is certainly *not* what the script writer intended!
Rather than defining strings using actual characters, Instead, one should use
the equivalent escape sequences. For example::

    u = u'a-\u0233-\u8ce2-z'
    u = 'a-\u0233-\u8ce2-z'

<t tx="ekr.20060920054924">.. _OPML:                   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML
.. _`OPML 2.0 standard`:    http://www.opml.org

**Warning**: the OPML plugin is not fully functional at present.  Use with caution.

The OPML plugin creates two new commands that read and write
Leo outlines in OPML_ format.
The read-opml-file command creates a Leo outline from an .opml file.
The write-opml-file command writes the present Leo outline to an .opml file.

Various settings control what gets written to .opml files, and in what format.
As usual, you specify settings for the OPML plugin using leoSettings.leo.
The settings for the OPML are found in the node::

    @settings--&gt;Plugins--&gt;opml plugin

Here are the settings that control the format of .opml files.
The default values are shown.

- @bool opml_read_derived_files = True

  If True, Leo reads external files when reading .opml files.

- @string opml_namespace = leo:com:leo-opml-version-1

  The namespace urn for the xmlns attribute of &lt;opml&gt; elements.
  This value typically is not used, but it should refer to Leo in some way.

- @bool opml_use_outline_elements = True

  If True, Leo writes body text to &lt;:body&gt; elements nested in &lt;outline&gt; elements.
  Otherwise, Leo writes body text to :body attributes of &lt;outline&gt; elements.

  **Note**: Leo-specific attributes and elements are clearly distinguished from 'standard' opml elements:
  they are preceded by a colon, which marks them as members of the default namespace specified specified
  by this option.  Thus, all OPML text generated by this plugin should conform to the `OPML 2.0 standard`_.

- @string opml_version = 2.0

  The opml version string written to the &lt;OPML&gt; element.
  Use 2.0 unless there is a specific reason to use 1.0.

- @bool opml_write_body_text = True

  If True, Leo writes body text to the OPML file.

- @bool opml_write_derived_files = True

  If True, Leo writes external files when writing .opml files.

- @bool opml_write_leo_details = True

  If True, Leo writes the native attributes of Leo's &lt;v&gt; elements
  as attributes of the opml &lt;outline&gt; elements.
  The native attributes of &lt;v&gt; elements are
  a, descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes, expanded, marks,
  t, and tnodeList.

- @bool opml_write_leo_globals_attributes = True

  If True, Leo writes body_outline_ratio and global_window_position
  attributes to the &lt;head&gt; element of the .opml file.

- @bool opml_write_uAs = True

  If True, Leo writes unknown attributes (uA's) in &lt;:uA&gt; sub-elements of &lt;outline&gt; elements.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060920145745">Three commands in the Cmds:Body Editors menu allow to create and destroy separate editors in the body pane.
The Add Body Editor (add-editor) command adds a new editor in the body pane.
The Delete Body Editor (delete-editor) command deletes the presently selected editor,
The Change Body Editor (cycle-editor-focus) command cycles focus between editors in the body text.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060921064744.1">This section describe the format of external files.
Leo's `sentinel lines`_ are comments, and this section describes those comments.

The format of external files produced by Leo 4.0 and later meets the following goals:

- The minimum of sentinels needed to properly recreate the outline.

- A robust way of telling whether newlines belong to sentinels or not.
  Prior to Leo 4.0, deleting blank lines before and after sentinel lines
  could corrupt the outline structure of the external file.

- A minimum of intrusion and ugliness.

**New in Leo 4.2**:
Files derived from @thin use gnx's in @+node and @-node sentinels.
Such gnx's permanently and uniquely identify nodes.
Gnx's have the form::

    id.yyyymmddhhmmss
    id.yyyymmddhhmmss.n

The second form is used if two gnx's would otherwise be identical.

- id is a string unique to a developer, e.g., a cvs id.

- yyyymmddhhmmss is the node's creation date.

- n is an integer.

Here are the sentinels used by Leo, in alphabetical order.
Unless otherwise noted, the documentation applies to all versions of Leo.
In the following discussion, gnx denotes a gnx as described above.

\@&lt;&lt;
    A sentinel of the form @&lt;&lt;section_name&gt;&gt; represents a section reference.

    If the reference does not end the line,
    the sentinel line ending the expansion is followed by the remainder of the reference line.
    This allows the Read code to recreate the reference line exactly.

\@@
    The @@ sentinel represents any line starting with @ in body text
    except @*whitespace*, @doc and @others.
    Examples::

      @@nocolor
      @@pagewidth 80
      @@tabwidth 4
      @@code

\@afterref **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Marks non-whitespace text appearing after a section references.

\@+all **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Marks the start of text generated by the @all directive.

\@-all **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Marks the end of text generated by the @all directive.

\@at and \@doc
    The @+doc and @-doc sentinels delimit doc parts within a node that starts with @doc.
    These sentinels are nested within @body directives.
    Similarly, @+at and @-at sentinels delimit doc parts within a node that start with @ *whitespace*.
    We use the following **trailing whitespace convention**
    to determine where putDocPart has inserted line breaks::

        A line in a doc part is followed by an inserted newline
        if and only if the newline if preceded by whitespace.

    To make this convention work,
    Leo's write code deletes the trailing whitespace of all lines that are followed by a "real" newline.

    **Leo 4.0 and later**:
    The @+doc and @+at sentinels now contain the whitespace that follows
    the corresponding @doc or @ directives.

\@+body **(Leo 3.x only)**
    Marks the start of body text.

\@-body **(Leo 3.x only)**
    Marks the end of body text.

\@delims
    The @delims sentinel inserts @@delims sentinels into the external file.
    The new delimiter strings continue in effect until the next @@delims sentinel
    *in the external file* or until the end of the external file.
    Adding, deleting or changing @@delim *sentinels* will destroy Leo's ability to read the external file.
    Mistakes in using the @delims *directives* have no effect on Leo,
    though such mistakes will thoroughly mess up a external file as far as compilers,
    HTML renderers, etc. are concerned. 

\@+leo
    Marks the start of any external file.
    This sentinel has the form::

        &lt;opening_delim&gt;@leo&lt;closing_delim&gt;

    The read code uses single-line comments if &lt;closing_delim&gt; is empty.
    The write code generates single-line comments if possible.

    **New in Leo 4.0**: The @+leo sentinel contains other information following
    @leo.  For example::

        &lt;opening_delim&gt;@leo-ver=4-thin&lt;closing_delim&gt;

\@-leo
    Marks the end of the Leo file.
    Nothing but whitespace should follow this directive.

\@+middle **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Marks the start of intermediate nodes between the node that
    references a section and the node that defines the section.
    Typically no such sentinels are needed: most sections are defined in a direct child of the referencing node.

\@-middle **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Marks the end of intermediate nodes between the node that
    references a section and the node that defines the section.

\@+node and \@-node
    Mark the start and end of a node.

    **Leo 4.2 and later**::
    @+node and @-node sentinels use gnx's as described above::

        @+node:gnx:&lt;headline&gt;
        @-node:gnx:&lt;headline&gt;

    Leo generates these sentinels only for nodes containing body text.
    Leo no longer generates other @+node sentinels to indicate outline structure.
    As a result, there is no longer any need for @+body sentinels.

    **Before Leo 4.2**::
    @+node and @-node sentinels used child indices, and status fields as described below::

      @+node:&lt;child_index&gt;:&lt;status_fields&gt;:&lt;headline&gt;
      @-node::&lt;child_index&gt;:&lt;status_fields&gt;:&lt;headline&gt;

    &lt;child_index&gt; is a number from 1 to n indicating the index of the node in the list of its parent's children.
    &lt;status_field&gt; is the cloneIndex field of the form: "C=nnn", where nnn is an immutable clone index.
    &lt;headline&gt; contains *headline* text, not reference text.

\@nl **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Adds a newline to the body text.

\@nonl **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Suppresses a newline from the body text.

\@others
    The @+others sentinel indicates the start of the expansion of an @+others directive,
    which continues until the matching @-others sentinel.
    @others sentinels are nested within @body sentinels;
    the expansion of the @others directive always occurs within the body text of some node.

\@verbatim
    @verbatim indicates that the next line of the external file is not a sentinel.
    This escape convention allows body text to contain lines that would otherwise be considered sentinel lines.

\@@verbatimAfterRef
    @verbatimAfterRef is generated when a comment following a section reference would otherwise be treated as a sentinel.
    In Python code, an example would be::

      &lt;&lt; ref &gt;&gt; #+others

    This sentinel is required only when blank lines are suppressed between sentinel lines.</t>

Leo 4.4.2 beta 1 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.2:
----------------------------
- You can now store settings in myLeoSettings.leo without fear of those settings
  being changed by cvs updates or in future versions of Leo.
- Leo's vnode and tnode classes are now completely independent of the rest of Leo.
  Some api's have been changed.  This 'big reorg' and may affect scripts and plugins.
- Leo's vnode and tnode classes can optionally be compatible with ZODB databases,
  i.e., they can optionally derive from ZODB.Persistence.Persistent.
  See Chapter 17: Using ZODB with Leo for details.
- The leoOPML plugin defines commands to read and write OPML files.
- The slideshow plugin allows Leo to run slideshows defined by @slideshow and @slide nodes.
- The leo_to_rtf and leo_to_html plugins create rtf and html files from Leo outlines.
- Much faster navigation through the outline using Alt-arrow keys.
- When focus is in the outline pane, you can move to headlines by typing the first letter of headlines.
- The find command now closes nodes not needed to show the node containing the present match.
- Numerous changes that make Leo easier to use without using a mouse.
- Many new minibuffer commands now appear in the Cmds menu.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928172457.4">- Added support for controlling Leo from Emacs_ with pymacs_.
  See `Chapter 18: Leo and Emacs`_ for full details.
- Added Minibuffer and Settings submenus of the Cmds menu.
- At long last Leo creates a proper help menu on the Mac.
- Added a new convention for menu tables. If the first item (a string
  representing the menu label) starts with '*' Leo will convert hyphens to
  spaces and upcase the label. This convention allows a single string to
  represent both the menu label and its associated minibuffer command. As part
  of this reorganization, all menu tables in Leo's core now use only strings.
  This is an essential precondition to supporting @menu nodes in
  leoSettings.leo.
- Leo's Help menu now contains the Open scripts.leo command.
- Leo uses ctypes to import Aspell when run from Python 2.5 or later.
  Leo no longer needs Python-specific versions of aspell.dll.
- Added support for x-windows middle-button paste.
  This only works when the paste is made in the pane containing the selected text.
- Leo looks for myLeoSettings.leo files in the same place Leo looks for leoSettings.leo files.
- Created three scripts (in test.leo) that help create unit tests for Leo's edit commands.
  Create Created runEditCommandTest for use by these scripts.
- Improved print-bindings command.
  The bindings are sorted by prefix: this is a big help in understanding bindings.
  For each prefix, first print items with only a single character after the prefix.
- Made writing .leo files faster.
  The new code almost exactly twice as fast as the old.
- Added p.archivedPosition.
  This is a key first step towards Leap 204.
- Integrated sax with read logic.
- You can now store settings in myLeoSettings.leo without fear of those settings
  being changed by cvs updates or in future versions of Leo.
- Eliminated unnecessary redraws when moving the cursor in the outline pane.
- Much faster navigation through the outline using Alt-arrow keys.
- When focus is in the outline pane, you can move to headlines by typing the first letter of headlines.
- The find command now closes nodes not needed to show the node containing the present match.
- Numerous changes that make Leo easier to use without using a mouse.
- Many new minibuffer commands now appear in the Cmds menu.

Further improved outline navigation:

- Generalized navigation in outline pane to ignore @file, @thin, etc prefixes.
- Made outline navigation cumulative.
  When keystrokes in the outline pane are typed 'close' together Leo first tries to look
  for prefix + ch, where ch is the character just typed and prefix is the previous match.
  The term 'close together' is specified by the setting @float outline_nav_extend_delay.
  The outline search revers to a single-character if the extended search
  fails, so in fact the delay is not too significant. In practice everything works
  well without me thinking at all about what is happening.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928172457.5">- Improved the mod_scripting plugin. Every button created by the plugin creates
  a corresponding command. The command name is the 'cleaned' version of the
  button name. Likewise, the plugin also creates a delete-x-button command,
  where x is the command name as just discussed. So now you can delete script
  buttons without right-clicking.
- Made 'About Plugin' dialog scrollable.
- Fixed bugs in groupoperations, multifile, nodenavigator and shortcut_button plugins.
- The rst3 plugin now registers the rst3-process-tree command.
- The leoOPML.py plugin defines commands to read and write OPML files.
- The slideshow.py plugin allows Leo to run slideshows defined by @slideshow and @slide nodes.
- The leo_to_rtf and leo_to_html plugins create rtf and html files from Leo outlines.
- The paste_as_headlines.py plugins creates multiple headlines at once.
- The word_count.py plugin.

Improved the mod_scripting plugin:

- Made showing the Run Script button optional.
- The Script Button button now creates the press-script-button-button command.
- A new utility method does a much better job of massaging button and command names.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20060928172525.195">@nocolor

My present thinking is that scripts should be able to store/retrieve persistent
objects to/from the zodb. That is, the zodb plugin is likely to be retired.

Leo's vnode and tnode classes now derive from ZODB.Persistence.Persistent if
leoNodes.use_zodb is True. It remains to be seen whether having use_zodb = True
will cause any serious problems.

See the posting below (Scripting using zodb) for latest details.

See the node 'zodb get/put buttons' in test.leo for examples of how scripts can access zodb easily.

Created g.init_zodb and v.detach.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928172525.197">&gt; Do you see zodb as persisting Leo files or Leo nodes?

Interesting question.  I now see the zodb plugin as a proof-of-concept for *user-defined* scripts.  The zodb plugin is probably going to go away.

Let us suppose that db is a ZODB.DB instance. (To see how to create such an instance, see the init_zodb method in the zodb plugin.  Perhaps I'll defines something like g.openZodb to make this easier.)  Then the statements:

connection = db.open()
root = connection.root()
root[aKey] = v
get_transaction().commit()
connection.close()

will write all of v's data (all vnodes and tnodes) to the zodb.  This is true whatever v is: it can be the root of an entire outline, or any suboutline.  If you want to write a single node, you would have to 'detach' that node from the outline.  You can do this by copying the node and then unlinking the node from its descendants. Perhaps I could add a convenience method to the vnode class to make this easier.

&gt;Do you see zodb work as providing enhanced access to nodes across multiple files?

Scripts could do so easily.  Happily, the distinction between 'long-lived' and 'short-lived' connections is not important for scripts: a script should hold a connection open only for as long as needed.  So it would be easy to write any number of vnode trees to the zodb.  Later, another script could access any of the data in the zodb by zodb key.  Like this:

connection = db.open()
root = connection.root()
v = root.get(aKey)
p = leoNodes.position(v,[])

After running this script, p is a position representing the root of the tree of 'imported' vnodes.  The script above does not 'connect' the imported trees to an outline, nor should it do so.  As I write this, I realize that the position ctor should make the second argument optional, so that leoNodes.position(v) would be equivalent to leoNodes.position(v,[]).

Each script should open at most connection at a time and be sure to close any zodb connection it creates.  The proper way to do this is in a finally statement, like this:

try:
....connection = db.open()
....root = connection.root()
....v = root.get(aKey)
....p = leoNodes.position(v,[])
....&lt;&lt; do something with the nodes in p's tree&gt;&gt;
finally:
....get_transaction().commit()
....connection.close()

In short, the recent changes to Leo's vnode and tnode classes give scripts the ability to save/retrieve Leo data to/from the zodb in any way a script wants, without any further support from Leo, or from me.

I shall spend an hour or two more with the zodb plugin, but it looks to me that the plugin has served its purpose.  Rather than trying to guess how people will want to use the zodb, it will be simpler and more general to have people write scripts that do exactly what they want.  In particular, such scripts can easily sidestep the problems with multiple open connections.

Edward

P.S. Please note that the scripts shown above could not have been written without all the recent work with the zodb plugin and the big code reorg.

P.P.S. A couple of unit tests involving the new v/t.__hash__ methods just failed, so it may be just a little bit longer before the code on cvs is truly zodb ready.  I'll also be working on example scripts and the convenience methods described above.

    ** The idea is that I'll use extend mode instead.
- Stay in outline mode: added @bool stayInTreeAfterEditHeadline setting.
- Added Cmds:Toggle Settings submenu.
- Use emacs names in Cmds menu (and in some other places): allow single item in menu tables.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20060928172525.81">What I did:
    
- Removed c argument from t, v and p ctors.
- Removed c argument from most position methods.
    - In particular, p.link, p.unlink, v.link and v.unlink no longer update c.currentPosition()
    - Moved all position methods that still had a c argument to the Commands class.
- Removed p.all_positions.
- Added c.findRootPosition and c.findRootVnode.
- c.rootPosition now returns c.findRootPosition(c.currentPosition())

As a result:
    
- The tnode, vnode and position classes are *completely* independent of Leo.
  In particular, no tnode, vnode or position method gets a c argument.
- The p.link, p.unlink, v.link and v.unlink are significantly simpler.
- The machinery for keeping the root position up-to-date is
  simple and confined to one place in the Commands class.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928194633.1">The myLeoSettings.leo file is a way of ensuring that your customized settings are not altered when updating Leo from cvs or while installing a new version of Leo.  The myLeoSettings.leo acts much like Python's site-customize.py file.  The myLeoSettings.leo file will never be part of any Leo distribution, and it will never exist in Leo's cvs repository.  This solution is *much* better than trying to update leoSettings.leo with scripts.

Leo loads settings from myLeoSettings.leo *after* loading settings from leoSettings.leo files but *before* loading settings from the .leo file being opened.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928195040"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928195040.1">The following plugins are new in Leo 4.4.2 b2:
    
leo_to_rtf
leo_to_html
leoOPML  (At present, contained in leoOPML.leo instead of leoPlugins.leo)
paste_as_headlines
slideshow
word_count

The __saxRead__.py plugin is an **experimental** for use by EKR.
It will be folded into Leo's core in the near future.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928200207.1">This plugin takes an outline stored in LEO and outputs it as a numbered list to
an RTF file. The RTF file can be loaded into Microsoft Word and formatted as a
proper outline.

If this plug-in loads properly, you should have an "Outline to Microsoft RTF"
option added to your File &gt; Export... menu in Leo.

Settings such as outputting just the headlines (vs. headlines &amp; body text) and whether
to include or ignore the contents of @file nodes are stored in the rtf_export.ini file
in your Leo\plugins folder.

The default export path is also stored in the INI file. By default, it's set to c:\ so
you may need to modify it depending on your system.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928200207.2">This plugin takes an outline stored in LEO and converts it to html which is
then either saved in a file or shown in a browser.

The outline can be represented as a bullet list, a numbered list or using html
&lt;h?&gt; type headings. Optionally, the body text may be included in the output.

If desired, only the current node will be included in the output rather than
the entire outline.

An xhtml header may be included in the output, in which case the generated html
will be valid XHTML 1.0 Strict.

The plugin is fully scriptable as all its functionality is available through a
Leo_to_HTML object which can be imported and used in scripts.

Several commands and menu items are provided to give easy access to the plugins
various features and options may be set via leo_to_html.ini file and the plugins
properties dialog.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928200207.3">This plugin reads and writes Leo outlines in .opml (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML) format.

The OPML plugin creates two new commands that read and write Leo outlines in OPML format.
The read-opml-file command creates a Leo outline from an .opml file.
The write-opml-file command writes the present Leo outline to an .opml file.

Various settings control what gets written to .opml files, and in what format.
As usual, you specify settings for the OPML plugin using leoSettings.leo.
The settings for the OPML are found in the node: @settings--&gt;Plugins--&gt;opml plugin

Here are the settings that control the format of .opml files. The default values are shown.

- @string opml_namespace = leo:com:leo-opml-version-1

  The namespace urn for the xmlns attribute of &lt;opml&gt; elements.
  This value typically is not used, but it should refer to Leo in some way.

- @bool opml_use_outline_elements = True

  If True, Leo writes body text to &lt;:body&gt; elements nested in &lt;outline&gt; elements.
  Otherwise, Leo writes body text to :body attributes of &lt;outline&gt; elements.

- @string opml_version = 2.0

  The opml version string written to the &lt;OPML&gt; element.
  Use 2.0 unless there is a specific reason to use 1.0.

- @bool opml_write_body_text = True

  Leo writes body text to the OPML file only if this is True.

- @bool opml_write_leo_details = True

  If True, Leo writes the native attributes of Leo's &lt;v&gt; elements as attributes of
  the opml &lt;outline&gt; elements. The native attributes of &lt;v&gt; elements are a,
  descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes, expanded, marks, t, and tnodeList.

- @bool opml_write_leo_globals_attributes = True

  If True, Leo writes body_outline_ratio` and global_window_position attributes to
  the &lt;head&gt; element of the .opml file.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928200600">This plug-in takes any text is stored in the clipboard and creates new headlines
for each line of text. The paste routine checks to make sure the line of text is not
greater than 50 characters in length. If it is, the routine truncates the headline to
50 characters and pastes the entire line into the body text of that node.

If the plug-in is functioning properly, a "Paste as Headlines" option should appear in
the Edit menu directly under the existing Paste option.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928201227">This plugin displays a message box with information about the body text of the current node 
such as number of: characters, words, lines, and paragraphs. It adds a "Word Count..." option
to the bottom of the Edit menu that will activate the message box.

The Word Count... menu has a shortcut key of 'W'.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928201227.1">This plugin supports slideshows in Leo outlines.

It defines four new commands:

- next-slide-show:  move to the start of the next slide show,
  or the first slide show if no slide show has been seen yet.

- prev-slide-show:  move to the start of the previous slide show,
  or the first slide show if no slide show has been seen yet.

- next-slide: move to the next slide of a present slide show.

- prev-slide: move to the previous slide of the present slide show.

Slides shows consist of a root @slideshow node with descendant @slide nodes.
@slide nodes may be organized via non-@slide nodes that do not appear in the slideshow.

All these commands ignore @ignore trees.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060929040750">Leo has many commands that select nodes in the outline. These commands can be
found in the Outline:Go To menu.

When focus is in the outline Pane, you can move to from
node to node by typing the first letter of a headline. For example, typing 'a'
will go to the next visible headline that starts with either 'a' or 'A',
wrapping around to the start of the outline if needed. Typing an uppercase 'A'
will go to the next headline that starts with 'a' or 'A', making the node
visible (expanding its ancestors) if the node was not visible.

When keystrokes (in the outline pane) are typed 'close' together in time Leo
first looks for prefix + ch, where ch is the character just typed and prefix is
the previous match. The term 'close together' is defined by the setting: 

@float outline_nav_extend_delay = 2.0 

The outline nav search reverts to a single-character search if the extended
search fails, so in fact the delay is not too significant. In practice
everything works well without thinking about what is happening. </t>
<t tx="ekr.20060929043325">Leo's vnode and tnode classes are now completely independent of the rest of Leo.
Some api's have been changed.  This 'big reorg' and may affect scripts and plugins.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060929043325.1">Leo's vnode and tnode classes can optionally be compatible with ZODB databases,
i.e., they can optionally derive from ZODB.Persistence.Persistent.
See Chapter 17: Using ZODB with Leo for details.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061003204952">Plugins and scripts can create new tabs in the log panel.
The following creates a tab named test or make it visible if it already exists::

    c.frame.log.selectTab('Test')

g.es, g.enl, g.ecnl, g.ecnls write to the log tab specified by the optional
tabName argument. The default for tabName is 'Log'. The put and putnl methods of
the tkinterLog class also take an optional tabName argument which defaults to
'Log'.

Plugins and scripts may call the
c.frame.canvas.createCanvas method to create a log tab containing a Tk.Canvas
widget. Here is an example script::

    log = c.frame.log ; tag = 'my-canvas'
    w = log.canvasDict.get(tag)
    if not w:
        w = log.createCanvas(tag)
        w.configure(bg='yellow')
    log.selectTab(tag)
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061003204952.1">The c.frame.log class contains the following 'official' ivars::

    g.es('tabName',c.frame.log.tabName)     # The name of the active tab.
    g.es('tabFrame',c.frame.log.tabFrame)   # The Tk.Frame containing all the other widgets of the tab.
    g.es('logCtrl',c.frame.log.logCtrl)     # Tk.Text widget containing the log text.

The following ivars provide access to the body pane::

    g.es('bodyFrame',c.frame.body.frame)    # The Tk.Frame widget containing the c.frame.body.bodyCtrl

The following ivars provide access to the outline pane::

    g.es('canvas',c.frame.tree.canvas) # The Tk.Canvas on which Leo's outline is drawn.

Tkinter provides a way of determining the enclosing widget of any widget.
The body text is enclosed in a Pmw.PanedWidget to support multiple editors.

    w = c.frame.body.bodyCtrl
    parent = w.pack_info().get('in') 
    g.es('bodyCtrl.parent',parent) # The Tk.Frame containing the body text.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061003204952.2">The following line removes the initial text widget::

    c.frame.log.logCtrl.pack_forget()

To make the text widget visible again::

    c.frame.log.logCtrl.pack(side='top',expand=1,fill='both')

Plugins and scripts can pack any other widgets into c.frame.log.tabFrame.
For example, the following replaces the default text widget with a red box::

    import Tkinter as Tk

    # Remove the old contents.
    w = c.frame.log.logCtrl
    parent =  w.pack_info().get('in')
    w.pack_forget()

    # Replace with a red frame.
    f = c.frame.newLog = Tk.Frame(parent,background='red')
    f.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')

And the following will restore the original pane::

    c.frame.newLog.pack_forget()
    w = c.frame.log.logCtrl
    w.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061003204952.3">Warning: you will find it hard to execute scripts after removing the body pane,
so you had best make the following two scripts into script buttons before
executing them :-)

Plugins and scripts can pack any other widgets into c.frame.log.tabFrame.
For example, the following replaces the default text widget with a red box::

    import Tkinter as Tk

    w = c.frame.body.bodyCtrl
    parent =  w.pack_info().get('in')
    w.pack_forget()

    f = c.frame.newBody = Tk.Frame(parent,background='red')
    f.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')

To restore::

    c.frame.newBody.pack_forget()
    w = c.frame.body.bodyCtrl
    w.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061003204952.4">The following replaces the outline pane with a red frame::

    import Tkinter as Tk

    w = c.frame.tree.canvas
    parent =  w.pack_info().get('in')
    w.pack_forget()

    f = c.frame.newTree = Tk.Frame(parent,background='red')
    f.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')

And this script restores the outline::

    c.frame.newTree.pack_forget()
    c.frame.tree.canvas.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061003212136">The following is no substitute for a full discussion of programming the Tk.Text
widget: it can do lots.

To clear the log::

    w = c.frame.log.logCtrl
    w.delete('1.0','end')

To write a line to the end of the log::

    w = c.frame.log.logCtrl
    w.insert('end','This is a test\n')

To get the entire contents of the log::

    w = c.frame.log.logCtrl
    g.es(w.get('1.0','end')+'\n')</t>

Leo's theory of relativity

1. We can archive any position p by saving the list [p.childIndex() for p in
   p.self_and_parents_iter()]. Let us call the *reverse* of this list the
   **parents index list**. Clearly, this list provides an unambiguous way of
   reaching position p from the root node. Archived positions, like all other
   positions, become invalid when the outline changes. 
 
2. Leo's position class can be based on parents index lists. Let us call such
   positions **new positions**. Replacing legacy positions with new position
   will have important benefits: 
 
- The only structure information in vnodes will be a v.links field. Two
  interpretations of v.links are possible. When Leo's data is a DAG (the clone
  world), v.links is a lists of v's children. This is the legacy world we all
  know and love. When Leo's data is an arbitrary graph, v.links is simply the
  list of all vnodes to which v points, with *no* necessary restrictions on what
  nodes may be contained in v.links. 
 
- New positions provide a self contained way of traversing an arbitrary graphs
  **largely independently** of the data. This is Leo's theory of relativity. The
  notions of 'parent' and 'sibling' have meaning *only* in the context of a
  particular position. The v.links field appears to be the absolute minimum
  amount of structure information that vnodes must contain. v.links defines the
  children or linked-to nodes in a general graph. 
 
- Leo's data can be considered an unrooted tree: *any* node could be considered
  the root. New positions provide enough information to traverse an arbitrary
  graph starting at any node. 
 
- The fundamental p.moveToX methods should be significantly faster. All of Leo's
  iterators use p.moveToX methods. 
 
3. The changeover to new positions can be done easily. Initially, the api of the
   new position class will be identical to the api of the present position
   class. Later, the api for the new position class might be extended in an
   upward compatible manner. The api's for the vnode and tnode class will remain
   strictly unchanged. 
 
4. These changes imply no change to the separation of data into vnodes and
   tnodes. This separation is required to handle clones. Furthermore, the format
   of .leo files is a separate issue from the internal representation of Leo's
   data, as proved by the opml plugin. Thus, the transition to new positions
   will have *no* effect on file formats, and no effect of scripts. All scripts
   will continue to work *exactly* as they have before, *except* scripts, e.g.
   unit tests, that probe Leo's internals. 
 
Summary 
 
Leo's theory of relativity is this: the position class provides a 'frame of
reference' for traversing data. **Only in a particular frame of reference** do
the notions of 'parent' and 'siblings' have meaning. Leo's theory of relatively
is the ultimate expression of LeoUser's notion of a 'sea of nodes'. It provides
a solid context on which to base traversals of either outlines with clones
(DAG's) or general directed graphs. 
 
Leo's position class, far from being just a technical tool, is important
theoretically. The position class (old or new) provides the essential tool
needed to separate data from traversals of the data. The re-visioning of the
position and vnode classes brings that potential into reality.

The problem is that autocompletion depends on state: self.leadinWord,
prevObjects, etc. Thus, it's not presently possible to start the process
anywhere. Similar remarks apply to calltips, which relies on autocompleter
state.

This is a complex problem, and not very serious now that there is an easy way of
toggling autocompleter and calltips on and off. It's been added to a 'later'

<t tx="ekr.20061025070825.1">The leoPymacs module is intended to be called from Emacs using pymacs.  It contains the following top-level functions:

- get_app()

  Returns the hidden app created by the leoPymacs.init function.

- dump(anyPythonObject)

  Returns str(repr(anyPythonObject)).

- get_g()

  Returns the leoGlobals module of the hidden app created by the leoPymacs.init function.

- get_script_result()

  Returns g.app.scriptResult, where g.app is the hidden app.

- init()
  Calls leo.run(pymacs=True) to create a hidden Leo application.
  Later calls to open can open hidden Leo outlines that can be accessed via runScript.

- open(fileName)

  Opens the .leo file given by fileName.
  fileName must be the full path to a .leo file.
  Returns the commander of the open Leo outline, or None if the outline could not be opened.

- run_script(c,script,p=None)

  Executes a script in the context of a commander c returned by the leoPymacs.open.
  c may be None, in which case a dummy commander is created in which to run the script.
  In the executed script, p is set to c.p if no p argument is specified.
  Returns g.app.scriptResult, where g.app is the hidden app.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061025081359">Leo's leoPymacs module is a simple 'server' for the pymacs_ package.
Using pymacs and leoPymacs, elisp_ scripts in Emacs_ can open .leo files and execute *Python* scripts
as if they were executed inside Leo.
In particular, such scripts can use Leo's predefined c, g and p variables.
Thus, *Python* scripts running in Emacs can:

- Open any .leo file. 
- Access any part of the outline. 
- Change any part of the outline, including external files, 
- Save .leo files.
- Execute *any* Leo script.

In short, you can now do from Emacs anything that you can do with Leo scripting inside Leo.

Here are step-by-step instructions for executing Python scripts in Emacs:

**Step 1. Install pymacs** 

   The pymacs installation instructions should be clear enough.
   A clarification is needed about two-way communication between Python and lisp scripts:
   in truth, Python scripts can call the Pymacs.lisp function *only* if the Python script
   was invoked from emacs.
   Otherwise, calling Pymacs.lisp will hang the process making the call.
   For example, executing the following script as an ordinary Leo script will hang Leo::

        from Pymacs import lisp
        print lisp("""2+2""") # Hangs

**Step 2. Load the leoPymacs module from Emacs, creating a hidden Leo application**

  From inside Emacs, you load Leo's leoPymacs module as follows::

    (pymacs-load "leoPymacs" "leo-")

  The call to pymacs-load is similar to 'import leoPymacs as leo-' in Python.
  The side effect of pymacs-load is to define the elisp function leo-x for every top-level function x in leoPymacs.py,
  namely leo-dump, leo-get-app, leo-get-g, leo-get-script-result, leo-init, leo-open and leo-run-script.
  The first call to any of these functions creates a **hidden Leo application**
  in which .leo files may be loaded, modified and saved,
  and in which Leo scripts may be executed.
  This hidden Leo application uses Leo's nullGui class as its gui,
  so Leo commands and Leo scripts that require a fully functional gui will not work as
  expected in the hidden Leo application.
  Steps 3 and 4 tell how to use this hidden Leo application.

  pymacs-load works like a Python reload, so you can redefine leoPymacs.py while Emacs is running.
  However, calling pymacs-load destroys the old hidden Leo application and creates a new one,
  so typically you would want to call pymacs-load only once per Emacs session.
  Like this::

        (setq reload nil) ; change nil to t to force a reload.

        (if (or reload (not (boundp 'leoPymacs)))
            (setq leoPymacs (pymacs-load "leoPymacs" "leo-"))
            (message "leoPymacs already loaded")
        )

**Step 3. From Emacs, open .leo files**

   Once we have loaded the leoPymacs module
   we can open a .leo file as follows::

    (setq c (leo-open fileName))

   This binds the elisp c variable to the Leo commander created by opening fileName.
   fileName should be the full path to a .leo file.
   In the next step we will use this c variable to execute *Leo* scripts in the
   context of an open Leo outline.

   Sometimes we want to execute a Leo script before opening any Leo commanders.
   For example, we might want to compute the fileName passed to leo-open.
   leo-run-script allows the c argument to be nil,
   in which case leo-run-script creates a dummy commander in which to run the script.
   For example, the following script calls g.os_path_join and g.os_path_abspath::

        (setq script "g.app.scriptResult =
            g.os_path_abspath(g.os_path_join(
                g.app.loadDir,'..','test','ut.leo'))"
        )

        (setq fileName (leo-run-script nil script))

   leo-run-script returns the value of g.app.scriptResult
   As shown above, Python scripts may set g.app.scriptResult to indicate their result.
   elisp scripts can also get g.app.scriptResult using leo-script-result.
   Note that the Python script may span multiple lines.

**Step 4. From Emacs, execute Leo (Python) scripts**

   From emacs we can execute a Python script **as if** it were executed in an
   open Leo outline.
   Suppose aLeoScript is an **elisp** string containing a Leo (Python) script.
   We can execute that script in the hidden Leo application as follows::

        (leo-run-script c aLeoScript)

   For example::

        (setq c (leo-open fileName)
        (csetq script "print 'c',c,'h',c.p.h")
        (leo-run-script c script)

Putting this all together, we get::

        ; Step 1: load leoPymacs if it has not already been loaded.
        (setq reload nil)
        (if (or reload (not (boundp 'leoPymacs)))
            (setq leoPymacs (pymacs-load "leoPymacs" "leo-"))
            (message "leoPymacs already loaded")
        )

        ; Step 2: compute the path to leo/test/ut.leo using a Leo script.
        (setq script
            "g.app.scriptResult = g.os_path_abspath(
                g.os_path_join(g.app.loadDir,'..','test','ut.leo'))"
        )
        (setq fileName (leo-run-script nil script))

        ; Step 3: execute a script in ut.leo.
        (setq c (leo-open fileName))
        (setq script "print 'c',c.shortFileName() ,'current:',c.p.h")
        (leo-run-script c script)</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061025142434">Leo's mini-buffer is a text area at the bottom of the body pane.
You use Leo's minibuffer like the Emacs mini-buffer to invoke commands by their so-called *long name*.
The following commands affect the minibuffer:

- **full-command**: (default shortcut: Alt-x) Puts the focus in the minibuffer. Type a
  full command name, then hit &lt;Return&gt; to execute the command. Tab completion
  works, but not yet for file names.

- **quick-command-mode**: (default shortcut: Alt-x) Like Emacs Control-C. This mode is
  defined in leoSettings.leo. It is useful for commonly-used commands.

- **universal-argument**: (default shortcut: Alt-u) Like Emacs Ctrl-u. Adds a repeat
  count for later command. Ctrl-u 999 a adds 999 a's.

- **keyboard-quit**: (default shortcut: Ctrl-g) Exits any minibuffer mode and puts
  the focus in the body pane.

For example, to print a list of all commands type Alt-X print-commands &lt;Return&gt;.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20061129170155.2">CC2 allocated objects one-at-a-time (simple allocation), in blocks of
fixed-sized objects (block allocation) or in blocks of variable-sized objects
(lifetime-based allocation). Simple-allocation was used for short-lived objects
and will not be discussed further. Block allocation was used in several ways, the
most interesting of which was to allocate "cons cells" used to represent lists.
These cons cells could be reused by placing them on a global avail list. Thus,
the blocks holding cons cells could (and did) have permanent lifetime: they were
never deallocated.

eventually came to call **lifetime-based** storage allocation. This was, for me,
an new discovery, though clearly I was not the first to discover it. The Aha is
that a lifetime is defined by the time (or equivalently by the place in program
code) at which objects are **deallocated**. A lifetime may hold many different
kinds of objects that were allocated at many different times. The essence of
lifetime-based allocation is that **the proper time to specify when an object
will be deallocated is when the object is created**.

Lifetime-based allocation is a superb invention:

- It becomes an effective design tool. Thinking of objects in terms of their
  lifetimes often shows the essence of a design problem.

- It can be used for any kind of object, regardless of its size or type.

- It reduces the number of calls to calloc and free by one or two orders of
  magnitude over naive schemes. Furthermore, it typically requests
  standard-sized blocks (say 8K or more) from calloc, further easing the burden
  on calloc and free.

- CC2 could allocate objects with a particular lifetime using small, extremely fast, macros.
  The macros expanded to C code something like this::

    if lifetime -&gt; avail &gt;= sizeof(theObjectKind) {
        // Allocate the storage.
        theObject = lifetime -&gt; ptr 
        lifetime -&gt; ptr += sizeof(theObjectKind)
    }
    else {
        &lt;&lt; allocate theObject in another block &gt;&gt;
    }

Importantly, the speed of the else clause makes absolutely no difference because
it is so seldom executed. Thus, it uses a function call. Clearly then, this code
is optimal: it could not be improved even if coded in assembly language.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061129170454">This white paper describes the storage allocation used in a commercial
optimizing C compiler written for Tuple, Inc. ca. 1993. The last section
discusses tantalizing possibilities for the pypy project. These possibilities
are why I wrote this paper.

Storage allocation is crucial to any compiler because of the number, size and
complexity of data which must be allocated. You might event say that a compiler
consists of storage allocation and everything else. I paid a lot of attention to
storage allocation in CC2, and that work paid off. The resulting compiler was a
few percent faster than the CodeWarrior C compiler, perhaps the fastest C
compiler in existence at that time. The original notes were written around 1993,
so I would do some things differently today. However, the design discussed below
still seems relevant today. Indeed, attention to low-level details can make a
huge difference.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061129175952">What makes lifetime-based allocation so powerful is that so few lifetimes are
typically required. Indeed, CC2 had only the following lifetimes:

- Permanent: These objects were never deallocated. Examples were list pointers
  held in cons cells and other kinds of application-wide objects.

- Tokenizer: Tokenizing in C is complex due to C's various preprocessing
  directives and macro expansion. Objects with tokenizer lifetime are
  deallocated before the parser starts.

- Function: Objects with function lifetime are deallocated after the compiler
  generates code for the function.

- File: Objects with file lifetime are deallocated after the compiler completes
  a source file.

That's all. Similarly, if Leo were recast as a C program only the following
lifetimes would be needed:

- Permanent: application-wide objects.

- Window/outline: All data associated with a single Leo outline. This is a
  'semi-permanent' lifetime. Leo has unlimited undo, so it is essentially
  impossible to delete any data object (an object that could be written to an
  output file) until the entire outline closes.

- Dialog: data associated with a temporary dialog.

- Function/method: data not used outside a single function or method.

The remarkable thing about dynamic languages like Python is how often objects
can, in fact, be assigned static lifetimes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061129202238">Lifetime allocation isn't used in Java, Python, etc. because these languages
have no way of knowing (in general) what the lifetime of any object will be.
Furthermore, translating Python to C would be straightforward were it not for
storage allocation issues. For example, most of Leo's code could easily be
translated into C, **provided** that the lifetime of all objects were known.
Again, just for example, the prospect of translating the Python version of Leo
to a fully optimized C version is tantalizing.

This is where pypy comes in: its extensive flow analysis may be sufficient to
discover lifetimes for a significant percentage of objects. Perhaps user hints
may be effective. For example, pypy offers the chance to make something like
`region inference`_ truly useful. Note that the pypy project might benefit from
deducing lifetimes even if not all objects could be assigned a static
lifetime. Another reason why lifetimes are not a standard technique is that they
are a potentially dangerous optimization. Errors in specifying lifetimes will
result in dangling pointer references. But this danger might disappear if pypy
could deduce lifetimes automatically.

<t tx="ekr.20070115172724">The following three section discuss three ways of debugging scripts with winpdb_.
The first two sections tell how to debug general scripts;
the last section tells how to debug Leo-specific scripts.

winpdb_ and its documentation have been improved recently.
For more details, see the `embedded winpdb`_ docs.
The discussion of embedded debugging may have been written specifically with Leo in mind.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070115172724.1">This way of debugging can only be used for general scripts, not leo-specific scripts.  
The debug command writes the script to scriptFile.py and invokes winpdb.
winpdb opens and is already 'attached' to the script to be debugged.
You can single-step as you like.
Leo continues to run, but killing the debugger will also kill Leo.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070115172724.2">test.leo contains an @button windpdb node.
Select the test to be debugged, then press the winpdb button or do &lt;Alt&gt;x winpdb&lt;return&gt;.
This way is essentially the same as using the debug command, though the code is slightly different.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070115172724.3">This way of debugging scripts allows winpdb to debug scripts that use c, g and p.
A bit more work is needed because winpdb does not start automatically.
Here are step-by step instructions:

1. Insert the following two lines of code at the start of the script to be debugged::

    import rpdb2
    rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger('go',fAllowUnencrypted=True)

2. Execute Leo's execute-script command (*not* the debug command).
   Leo will appear to hang: start_embedded_debugger is waiting for *another* copy of winpdb to 'attach' to the script's process.
   The default timeout is 5 minutes, after which an exception gets thrown.

3. Start winpdb explicitly by executing something like the following in a console::

    python /python25/Scripts/_winpdb.py -t

   The -t option tells winpdb that no encoding of password is necessary.
   The password is specified in the call to rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger in your script.
   In our example, the password is 'go'.

4. Use winpdb's File:Attach command to attach winpdb to Leo.
   Specify the password as 'go' and you will see the scriptFile.py containing your entire script.
   You can now execute or single-step through the script. 
   To repeat, c, g and p are defined, so you can debug any script this way.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070116062405">Inserting g.trace statements in my Python code is usually my first debugging
choice. The g.trace statement prints the name of the function in which the call
to g.trace occurs, followed by the value of its arguments. The output of the
g.trace goes to the console, so you must `run Leo in a console window`_ to use
g.trace.

Inserting and deleting g.trace statements is fast, provided that your `work
flow`_ makes it easy to restart the program under test. As a result, using
g.trace statements is similar to setting tracepoints in a debugger, with the
advantage that (disabled) tracepoints remain in the source code for future use.
You will find many examples of using g.trace throughout Leo's source code.

My second choice is using g.pdb to set breakpoints for the pdb_ debugger. Pdb
uses the console for all interaction, so you must `run Leo in a console window`_.
See `the FAQ`_ for a discussion of both g.trace and g.pdb.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070120075236">Leo's execute script command predefines the c, g and p constants
when it runs any script inside Leo:

- c is the commander of the outline containing the script.
- g is Leo's leo.core.leoGlobals module.
- p is the presently selected position, the same as c.p.

Leo scripts can use c and g to gain access to all of Leo's source code.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20070122070634.223">New settings

The following two new settings now control whether the execute-script and debug commands write the script to an external file.

- @bool write_script_file = True

True: The execute script command writes the script to be executed to a file, then executes the script using Python's execFile function. The script_file_path setting specifies the path to this file.
    
False (legacy): The execute script command uses Python's exec command to execute the script. 

- @string script_file_path = ../test/scriptFile.py

The path to the file to be written by the execute-script command.

Notes:
    
- This setting has effect only if the write_script_file setting is True.
- Use / to as the path delimiter, regardless of platform.
- The default path is ../test/scriptFile.py if no path is given.
- The path starts at g.app.loadDir, so for example ../test/scriptFile.py is equivalent to leo/test/scriptFile.py
- The filename should end in .py.

From here on, let us assume the settings are as shown above.  There are at least three ways of debugging scripts, depending on your preferences and whether the script contains leo-specific code (g, c or p) or not.

First way:  The debug command

The debug command now works almost exactly like Kent's original @button node. This way of debugging can only be used for general scripts, not leo-specific scripts.  

The debug command writes the script to scriptFile.py and invokes the debugger as specified by the existing @string debugger_kind option.  winpdb opens and is already 'attached' to the script to be debugged.  You can single-step as you like.  Leo continues to run, but killing the debugger will also kill Leo.  When started this way, winpdb is really 'attached' to *all* of Leo, which means you can single step past the end of the script into Leo's executeScript code and from there into all of Leo(!)

As I write this I realize that the code uses arguments specific to winpdb.  That may have to be generalized, though I am not sure why anyone would want to use another debugger...

Second way: @button winpdb

This is almost exactly equivalent to the debug command, except that the script file must be *different* from the script file specified by the  script_file_path setting (The @button code *itself* uses the execute-script command, so we have to pass the script code, not the @button code to the debugger).

Third way: The execute-script command with explicit debugger breaks

The third way of debugging scripts allows winpdb to debug scripts that use c, g and p.  I'm actually not sure of exactly how and why it works, but it certainly does work.

In contrast to the previous two ways, a little more work is needed because winpdb does not start automatically.  But I am getting ahead of myself.

To use this way, insert the following two lines of code at the start of the script to be debugged::

import rpdb2
rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger('go',fAllowUnencrypted=True)

Now just execute the execute-script command (*not* the debug command)  Leo will appear to hang.  Indeed, the  start_embedded_debugger command is waiting for *another* copy of winpdb to 'attach' to the script's process.  This process is all of Leo!  The default timeout is 5 minutes: I'm not sure what happens when the timeout happens: probably an exception gets thrown.

So you must start winpdb explicitly.  On XP just do something like

python c:\python25\Scripts\_winpdb.py -t

The -t option tells winpdb that no encoding of password is necessary.  The password is specified in the call to rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger in your script.  In this example, the password is 'go'.  Use the File:Attach command in winpdb to attach winpdb to Leo.  Specify the password as 'go' and you will see the scriptFile.py containing your entire script.  You can execute or single-step through the script. 

To repeat, the big difference is that c, g and p are defined, so you can debug any script this way.  As before, killing winpdb also kills Leo.

P.S.  winpdb and its documentation has been improved recently.  See

http://www.digitalpeers.com/pythondebugger/  and especially

http://www.digitalpeers.com/pythondebugger/embedded.htm

The discussion of embedded debugging may have been written specifically with Leo in mind.  It certainly could have been.

When a node is among several other nodes at the same level of hierarchy, which
are all children of a node, and the "MOVE LEFT" command is executed, the node
does move left in the outline hierarchy, but it also move down to just before
the next node at the higher hierarchy level - the level to which it is moving
left.

starts with the first letter typed and other letters are added if they are typed
within a 'short' period of time, as specified by the outline_nav_extend_delay

True: Look in invisible nodes.

Using the leoBridge module, foreign programs can get access to:
    
- all of Leo's source code,
- the contents of any .leo file,
- the commander of any .leo file.

Host programs use the leoBridge module as follows::

    import leoBridge

import the leoBridge module and create a **bridge controller**. In effect, these
statements embed an 'invisible' copy Leo into the host program. This embedded
copy of Leo uses a 'null' gui, which simulates all aspects of Leo's normal gui
code without creating any screen objects.

The statement::

    g = controller.globals()
    
provides access to Leo's leoGlobals module, and properly inits globals such as g.app, g.app.gui, etc.  Host programs **should not** import leoGlobals directly, because doing so would not init the g.app object properly.

The statement::

    c = controller.openLeoFile(path)
    
invisibly opens the .leo file given by the pathargument. This call returns a
completely standard Leo commander, properly inited. This is the big payoff from
the leoBridge module: the host program gets instant access to c.config.getBool,
etc. Do you see how sweet this is?

The following script runs leo/test/leoBridgeTest.py outside of Leo.
leoBridgeTest.py uses the leoBridge module to run all unit tests in leo/test/unitTest.leo.

I'm generating Leo files with ElementTree and ran into a minor issue.

ElementTree generates an empty tag with a space before the closing slash:
    
&lt;globals /&gt;

in Leo's code for dummy elements to allow copied nodes to be valid Leo files,
the empty tags are generated without the space

leoFileCommands.py 2917
        self.put('&lt;globals/&gt;\n')
        self.put('&lt;preferences/&gt;\n')
        self.put('&lt;find_panel_settings/&gt;\n')
        
it then checks for these tags in getDummyElements() leoFileCommands.py 1298

Since ElementTree has the space before the slash, 
it's XML is considered invalid by Leo according to
this test.

I would like it if the space could be added in Leo's
self.put(...) and the check in getDummyElements()

The XML specs show the space as optional.

Would it be possible to have the table of "Open With" editors to be part of
the config system? I find myself patching the list every time I D/L a new Leo
version to add the editor I use. This would also help isolate the user from
the "guts" of Leo, thereby being less intimidating.

<t tx="ekr.20070513111526.42">Leo now supports zipped .leo files:

- Leo now has save-file-as-zipped and save-file-as-unzipped commands, and
corresponding Save File As Zipped and Save File as Unzipped items in the File
menu. These are exactly the same as Leo's Save As commands except that they
temporarily force Leo to write the file in either zipped or unzipped format.

- Leo remembers whether a file was originally zipped. The read logic handles
either zipped or unzipped .leo files automatically. The write logic will zip the
file if it was originally zipped or if the save-file-as-zipped command is being
executed.

- Leo writes files with .leo extension, regardless of whether the file is zipped
or not. Zipped .leo files contain a single archive, whose name is the same as
the .leo file itself.

Notes:

- The new save commands suffice to compress and expand .leo files on a
file-by-file basis. In particular, there is no need for any user settings.

- Outside of Leo you can change the extension to .leo.zip and use stuffit or
other program to expand the .leo file contained within. I've only tested this on
XP, but it should work everywhere...

- At present the code uses Python's zipfile module to read and write zipped files.
In turn, the zipfile module uses the zlib module to do the compression.
Conceivably somebody might want Leo to use some other compression technique, say
Python's tarfile module. However, I think the present way should suffice for
most people.</t>

  Chapters are regions of a Leo outline whose root is an @chapter node. @chapter
  nodes may appear anywhere in an outline, but the create-chapter command (see
  below) creates @chapter nodes as children of a single @chapters node.
  
  Selecting a chapter shows only then nodes in the selected chapter; in this
  respect, chapters are like hoists. The main chapter represents the entire
  outline and can not be deleted by name. When chapters are in effect, Leo
  creates a hidden @chapters node containing one @chapter node for every chapter
  except the 'main' chapter.
  
  Associated settings:
      
  - The @bool use_chapters setting determines whether chapters are enabled.
  - The @bool use_chapter_tabs setting determines whether the chapters
    pop-up menu appears in the icon area. Choosing a chapter name from this list selects a chapter.

  When chapters are enabled, the Cmds:Chapters menu shows all available chapter commands:
      
  - The create-chapter command creates an @chapter node and with a single node.
  - The delete-chapter command deletes the presently selected chapter.
  - The select-chapter command makes only the nodes of the selected chapter visible.
  - The move-node-to-chapter, clone-node-to-chapter and copy-node-to-chapter commands
    add a node (and its descendants) to another chapter.</t>

- The node is selected, but shift-arrow does not work.

However, clicking the canvas does work.

The fix was to give the canvas, not the headline focus when clicking on a headline.
This results in canvas bindings, not text bindings, having priority.
This is not a kludge: the text widget isn't active, so text bindings should not be in effect.

<t tx="ekr.20070622180342">- Added support for chapters to Leo's core

  Chapters are regions of a Leo outline whose root is an @chapter node. @chapter
  nodes may appear anywhere in an outline, but the create-chapter command (see
  below) creates @chapter nodes as children of a single @chapters node.
  
  Selecting a chapter shows only then nodes in the selected chapter; in this
  respect, chapters are like hoists. The main chapter represents the entire
  outline and can not be deleted by name. When chapters are in effect, Leo
  creates a hidden @chapters node containing one @chapter node for every chapter
  except the 'main' chapter.
  
  Associated settings:
      
  - The @bool use_chapters setting determines whether chapters are enabled.
  - The @bool use_chapter_tabs setting determines whether the chapters
    pop-up menu appears in the icon area. Choosing a chapter name from this list selects a chapter.

  When chapters are enabled, the Cmds:Chapters menu shows all available chapter commands:
      
  - The create-chapter command creates an @chapter node and with a single node.
  - The delete-chapter command deletes the presently selected chapter.
  - The select-chapter command makes only the nodes of the selected chapter visible.
  - The move-node-to-chapter, clone-node-to-chapter and copy-node-to-chapter commands
    add a node (and its descendants) to another chapter.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070622185234">The 'official' way to start a replace command is::

    &lt;Ctrl-shift-r&gt;find-pattern&lt;return&gt;replace-text&lt;return&gt;

But suppose you with start with::

    &lt;ctrl-f&gt;find-pattern

and then realize you want to do a replace instead of a find.
No problem.  The following also works::

    &lt;Ctrl-f&gt;find-pattern&lt;Ctrl-shift-r&gt;replace-text&lt;return&gt;

In other words, you can think of `&lt;ctrl-f&gt;` as meaning 'show the find dialog'.
There is another trick you should know.
After typing `&lt;ctrl-f&gt;` or `&lt;shift-ctrl-r&gt;` you can use `&lt;alt-ctrl&gt;` keys to set or clear find options.
For example::

    &lt;ctrl-f&gt;&lt;alt-ctrl-w&gt;&lt;find-pattern&gt;&lt;return&gt;

That is, `&lt;ctrl-f&gt;`shows the find dialog,
`&lt;alt-ctrl-w&gt;` toggles the Whole Word checkbox and
`&lt;return&gt;` starts the search.
You can type the `&lt;alt-ctrl&gt;` keys anytime after `&lt;ctrl-f&gt;` (or `&lt;shift-ctrl-r&gt;`) and before `&lt;return&gt;`. 
You can also type multiple `&lt;alt-ctrl-keys&gt;` to toggle multiple checkboxes.</t>

Chapter 20: Unit testing with Leo
############################################################

This chapter describes how you can execute Python unit test from within Leo outlines.

.. _`run Leo in a console window`:      install.html#running-leo-from-a-console-window</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070628084351">**@test nodes** are nodes whose headlines start with @test. The unit test
commands convert the body text of @test nodes into a unit test automatically.
That is, Leo's unit test commands automatically create a unittest.TestCase
instances which run the body text of the @test node. For example, let us
consider one of Leo's actual unit tests. The headline is::

    @test consistency of back/next links

The body text is::

    if g.unitTesting:
        c,p = g.getTestVars() # Optional: prevents pychecker warnings.
        for p in c.all_positions():
            back = p.back()
            next = p.next()
            if back: assert(back.getNext() == p)
            if next: assert(next.getBack() == p)

When either of Leo's unit test commands finds this @test node the command will
run a unit test equivalent to the following::

    import leo.core.leoGlobals as g

    class aTestCase (unittest.TestCase):
        def shortDescription():
            return '@test consistency of back/next links'
        def runTest():
            c,p = g.getTestVars()
            for p in c.all_positions():
                back = p.back()
                next = p.next()
                if back: assert(back.getNext() == p)
                if next: assert(next.getBack() == p)

As you can see, using @test nodes saves a lot of typing:

- You don't have to define a subclass of unittest.TestCase.
- Within your unit test, the c, g and p variables are predefined, just like in Leo scripts.
- The entire headline of the @test node becomes the short description of the unit test.

**Important note**: notice that the first line of the body text is a **guard line**::

    if g.unitTesting:

This guard line is needed because this particular @test node is contained in the
file leoNodes.py. @test nodes that appear outside of Python source files do not
need guard lines. The guard line prevents the unit testing code from being
executed when Python imports the leoNodes module; the g.unitTesting variable is
True only while running unit tests.

**New in Leo 4.6**: When Leo runs unit tests, Leo predefines the 'self' variable to
be the instance of the test itself, that is an instance of unittest.TestCase.
This allows you to use methods such as self.assertTrue in @test and @suite nodes.

**Note**: Leo predefines the c, g, and p variables in @test and @suite nodes,
just like in other scripts.  Thus, the line::

    c,p = g.getTestVars()

is not needed.  However, it prevents pychecker warnings that c and p are undefined.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070628094515.1">**@suite nodes** are nodes whose headlines start with @suite. @suite nodes allow
you to create and run custom subclasses of unittest.TestCase.

Leo's test commands assume that the body of an suite node is a script that
creates a suite of tests and places that suite in g.app.scriptDict['suite'].
Something like this::

    if g.unitTesting:
        __pychecker__ = '--no-reimport' # Prevents pychecker complaint.
        import unittest
        c,p = g.getTestVars() # Optional.
        suite = unittest.makeSuite(unittest.TestCase)
        &lt;&lt; add one or more tests (instances of unittest.TestCase) to suite &gt;&gt;
        g.app.scriptDict['suite'] = suite

**Note**: as in @test nodes, the guard line, 'if unitTesting:', is needed only if the
@suite node appears in a Python source file.

Leo's test commands first execute the script and then run suite in
g.app.scriptDict.get('suite') using the standard unittest text runner.

You can organize the script in an @suite nodes just as usual using @others,
section references, etc. For example::

    if g.unitTesting:
        __pychecker__ = '--no-reimport'
        import unittest
        c,p = g.getTestVars() # Optional.
        # children define test1,test2..., subclasses of unittest.TestCase.
        @others 
        suite = unittest.makeSuite(unittest.TestCase)
        for test in (test1,test2,test3,test4):
            suite.addTest(test)
        g.app.scriptDict['suite'] = suite
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070628094515.2">The run-all-unit-tests-locally and run-unit-tests-locally commands run unit
tests in the process that is running Leo. These commands *can* change the
outline containing the unit tests.

The run-all-unit-tests and run-unit-tests commands run all tests in a separate
process, so unit tests can never have any side effects. These commands never
changes the outline from which the tests were run. These commands do the
following:

1. Copy all @test, @suite and @unit-tests nodes (including their descendants) to the
   file test/dynamicUnitTest.leo.

2. Run test/leoDynamicTest.py in a separate process.

   - leoDynamicTest.py opens dynamicUnitTest.leo with the leoBridge module.
     Thus, all unit tests get run with the nullGui in effect.

   - After opening dynamicUnitTest.leo, leoDynamicTest.py runs all unit tests
     by executing the leoTest.doTests function.

   - The leoTests.doTests function searches for @test and @suite nodes and
     processes them generally as described above. The details are a bit
     different from as described, but they usually don't matter. If you *really*

    --script scriptFile

If found, Leo enters batch mode. In batch mode Leo does not show any windows.
Leo assumes the scriptFile contains a Python script and executes the contents of
that file using Leo's Execute Script command. By default, Leo sends all
output to the console window. Scripts in the scriptFile may disable or enable
this output by calling app.log.disable or app.log.enable

Scripts in the scriptFile may execute any of Leo's commands except the Edit Body
and Edit Headline commands. Those commands require interaction with the user.
For example, the following batch script reads a Leo file and prints all the
headlines in that file::

    path = r"&lt;path-to-folder-containing-the-leo-folder&gt;\leo\test\test.leo"

    g.app.log.disable() # disable reading messages while opening the file
    flag,newFrame = g.openWithFileName(path,None)
    g.app.log.enable() # re-enable the log.

    for p in newFrame.c.all_positions():
        g.es(g.toEncodedString(p.h,"utf-8"))

<t tx="ekr.20070704074747">Leo's **unit test commands** run the unit tests
created by @test and @suite nodes. run-unit-tests and run-unit-tests-locally
run all unit tests in the presently selected part of the Leo outline;
run-all-unit-tests and run-all-unit-tests-locally run all unit
tests in the entire Leo outline.

Important: you must `run Leo in a console window`_ to see the output the unit tests.
Leo's unit test commands run all the unit tests using the standard unittest text test
runner, and the output of the unit tests appears in the console.

test/unitTest.leo contains many examples of using @test and @suite nodes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070723100037">Why, oh why, would anyone be interested in Leo? After all, Emacs and Vim are
superb text editors, and Visual Studio and Eclipse are great IDE's. How can Leo
possibly compete with such strong competition? What does Leo offer that these
other tools don't?

Leo does have something unique to offer--something missing from Emacs,Vim,
Visual Studio and Eclipse. Leo's users often speak of an Aha! moment when they
understand what this 'something' is. The Aha! arises from considering programs,
design and data in a new light. You might call this 'The Leo Way'. In essence,
Leo shows that computer programs, designs and data are *not*, after all, mostly
about text. Yes, people usually *express* programs, designs and data as text.
Yes, people manipulate programs, designs and data *using* text, but *text is not
the whole story*.

In The Leo Way, text is simply a manifestation (a shadow) of something more
fundamental. That 'something else' might be called 'organization' or 'structure'
or 'views' or even 'architecture'. However, let us use the term **node** to
represent the fundamental unit of structure in Leo. We'll see why in a moment.

In architectural terms, nodes are bricks that make up a building. In computer
programming terms, nodes make up methods, classes, files and entire
applications. So the term 'node' does *not* have a fixed meaning--it is simply a
unit of organization. Any node can be built from other nodes, and any node can
be used by any other node. Leo represent nodes directly, as nodes (headlines) in
an outline. An outline node contains a headline and body text. The **outline
pane** shows all headlines; the **body pane** shows the body text of the
presently selected node.

**Outline structure is real data**

To repeat: the fundamental unit in Leo is *not* text. True, headlines and body
*consist* of text, but a node is just not text, it is a true (Python) object.
This means several specific things:

1. Because nodes are true objects, Leo commands understand what a node is, and
   where a node fits into the entire outline. I'll say more about outline
   organization soon, but let me give an example. Every node has exactly one
   parent node, (except for top-level nodes that have no parents) and every node
   has zero or more children and zero or more siblings. A node's parent,
   children and siblings are real properties of the node, *completely
   independent* of the node's headline or body text. Furthermore, any of Leo's
   commands (or user-written scripts or plugins, the big sisters of user
   scripts.) can *easily* access the all aspects of an outline *without* having
   to parse any text whatsoever. Commands, scripts and plugins can easily do the
   following: get the root of the outline, the presently selected node in the
   outline, the parent, siblings, children or descendants of any node in the
   outline, etc., etc. Commands, scripts and plugins can easily insert, delete
   or move nodes, and can alter the headline or body text in any node. All this
   *without* parsing text.

2. Having nodes be true objects means that commands scripts and plugins can
   treat the headline text as *something truly different from* body text. The
   natural interpretation of headline text is as a description of the body text.
   This is important! Headlines often control Leo's commands. For example,
   headlines that start with @thin, @file, @asis, @auto, etc. serve to guide and
   control Leo's read and write commands. Headlines that start with @test,
   @suite and @mark-for-unit-tests guide Leo's unit testing commands. Moreover,
   it is easy to create new conventions for headlines that control user-written
   scripts or plugins. For example, plugins define specific meanings for
   headlines that start with @url, @rst, @bookmark, @slideshow, etc., etc. So
   the separation of headline and body text, **as true components of a node
   object**, is a very big deal.

3. One application of these ideas deserves special mention. Leo's scripting
   plugin provides support for @button nodes. The headline is @button
   &lt;command-name&gt;. The body text contains a script. When Leo opens a Leo
   outline, each @button node creates a command and an icon. Clicking the icon
   (or executing the command) applies the script in the @button node **to the
   presently selected outline**. That is, the script is executed in a context in
   which it is easy to get access to all aspects of the outline in which the
   script is embedded. This is a major advance in scripting. It allows you to
   'bring scripts to data', i.e., any part of an outline. In particular, it is
   very easy to create **editing scripts** that automate what would otherwise be
   boring and repetitive editing tasks.

**Leo outlines aren't your average outline**

Earlier I said that *any* node can be built from other nodes, and *any* node can
be used by any other node. It takes a very special kind of outline for this to
be possible. In a typical outline, such as Emacs outline mode, for example,
nodes appear exactly once in the outline. This makes it impossible to 'reuse'
nodes in multiple places. Leo removes that limitation: any outline node can be
**cloned**, and clones can appear in as many places in an outline as you like.

Cloned nodes are distinct: they must be distinct so they can be moved throughout
the outline, but **cloned nodes share all their information**. That is, changing
the headline or body text in a node instantly changes the headline and body text
in all the other nodes cloned to it. Furthermore, similar remarks apply to the
children and descendants of any node--changing any child (or other descendant)
of a node, say node A, instantly makes corresponding changes to all nodes cloned
to node A.

Earlier I said that you can think of nodes as representing 'organization' or
'structure' or 'views' or even 'architecture'. Clones are the crucial feature
that allows this point of view. For example, we can build up multiple 'views' of
data in an outline using clones as follows:

- Create a 'view node' that will represent a *user-specified* view.

- Clone all nodes that are to be part of the view, and move them so that each
  clone is a child of the view node.

That's about all there is to it. The view node, and its children *is* a new view
of the outline. This notion of 'view' is so important that Leo supports it
directly. Leo's **chapters** are simply views created as I have just described.
When you select one chapter, you only see the nodes of that chapter in Leo's
outline pane.

**Conclusions &amp; encouragements**

So Leo offers a new way to understand, organize and manipulate *any* kind of
complex data, including computer programs, *designs* of computer programs, web
sites, personal data, whatever. The Aha that I invite you to experience is this:
Outlines are more than mere eye candy. Having organization be real data creates
an entirely new dimension, literally and figuratively, in computer programming,
computer design and data organization, including web-site design, database
design, etc. Leo's commands use headline and body text in many creative ways. So
can you and your scripts. It's easy, it's fun, and it's revolutionary.

That's about it, except for some words of caution and advice:

1. Leo has been under active development for over 10 years. The new world
   created by nodes is rich and varied. You won't learn it all in a day or so.
   Please be patient. Start by learning Leo's basic features as explained in the
   tutorial. You can learn more advanced features later.

2. Those of you who are comfortable with Emacs should feel pretty much at home
   with Leo. Leo has shamelessly stolen the best features of Emacs, including
   the minibuffer and many Emacs-like commands.

3. For those of you who are *not* comfortable with Emacs, please understand that
   you do *not* need to understand all of Leo's commands in order to use Leo.
   Start by ignoring the minibuffer. Later, the minibuffer can become your
   friend, but you can get the Aha! without it.

<t tx="ekr.20070724081553">This section contains code-level notes for the threading colorizer. You do not
need to understand this material in order to use the threading colorizer.

The threading_colorizer plugin uses a separate **helper thread** to compute the
ranges of text that should be colored. **The helper thread must not contain any
calls to Tk**. Tk is not thread safe--calling Tk in the helper thread will cause
hard crashes in the Tk dll. However, the code in the helper thread is gui
independent. The **main thread** contains all of Leo's code except for a helper
thread. The main thread contains all calls to Tk, all entry points to the
colorizer, and idleHandler, an idle-time handler.

Only one helper thread is ever active at any one time. If a keystroke occurs
while the helper thread is active, the colorizer code in the main thread sets
the killFlag ivar and calls join to wait for the helper thread to terminate. The
helper thread will terminate promptly because it looks at killFlag each time
through its main loop. Using a separate helper thread allows the main thread to
continue working while the helper thread computes. This allows Tk (in the main
thread) to respond to events. This in turn allows the colorizer code in the main
thread to kill the helper thread if it is still working.

The helper thread runs to completion before the main thread
uses any of its results. Thus, no thread locking is needed, an important
simplification. Once the helper thread completes, the main thread computes the
tags to be sent to Tk, and actually sends those tags. When the user is typing
rapidly, the colorizer will ignore the results of all helper threads except the
last.

After the helper thread generates the list of all requested
tags, the main thread uses a kind of sort-merge algorithm to compare the
existing tags (obtained from Tk) with the requested tags. In many cases, the
lists are the same and colorizer issues *no* calls to Tk. This is a sensational
optimization.  It absolutely minimizes the load on Tk.

When the 'interruptible' argument to the colorizer is False,
no threading is used and the main thread completely colors the entire text. This
must be done when multiple body editors are present.</t>

The highlights of Leo 4.4.4:
----------------------------

- A threading_colorizer plugin replaces the __jEdit_colorizer__ plugin.
  This plugin features much better performance.

- Support for @auto nodes.  Such nodes allow people to collaborate using Leo

<t tx="ekr.20070806095535.1">@auto trees allows people to use Leo in collaborative environments without using
sentinels in the files Leo generates. In contrast to @nosent, @auto trees can
change when the corresponding file changes outside of Leo.

Leo will automatically recreate (import) all @auto trees when reading a .leo
file, and will write all dirty @auto trees when saving a .leo file. There are
two exceptions to this statement:

1. Leo will never read (import) or write an @auto tree if
the root @auto tree is under the influence of an @ignore directive.

2. Saving a .leo file does not save @auto nodes if a) they haven't been changed
or b) they do not contain a **significant** amount of information. An @auto tree
contains a significant amount of information if it has  children or if the
root node contains more than 10 characters.

Leo creates @auto trees by parsing the corresponding external file. Parsers
create descendant nodes of the @auto tree: one node for each class, method and
function in the external file.

Parsers presently exist for C, elisp, Java, Pascal, PHP and Python. Leo
determines the language using the file's extension. If no parser exists for a
language, the entire body of an @auto tree contains a significant amount of
information if it has any children or if the root node contains more than 10
non-blank lines. the external file is copied to the body of the @auto node.

Leo does not write the contents of @auto trees to .leo files. In this respect,
@auto trees work much like @thin trees. @auto trees whose root node is under the
scope of an @ignore directive *will* be written to the .leo, just like @thin
trees.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070806100055">All present parsers are short overrides of a powerful base parser class. Thus,
it would be simple to add support for other languages. See the node

@thin leoImport.py--&gt;Import--&gt;Scanners for createOutline

in leoPy.leo to see how easy it is to create new parsers.

write @auto nodes from the presently selected outline. As always, an @ignore
directive in the @auto node or its ancestors will suppress any of these
commands:

- The Read @auto Nodes (read-at-auto-nodes) command reads all @auto nodes in the
  presently selected outline. An @ignore directive will suppress this import.

- The Write @auto Nodes (write-at-auto-nodes) command writes all @auto nodes. An
  @ignore directive will suppress this import. Caution: the write will occur even
  if Leo has not previously read the @auto node.

- The Write Dirty @auto Nodes (write-dirty-at-auto-nodes) is the same as the
  write-at-auto-nodes command, except that only changed @auto trees are written.

Most users will rarely use these explicit commands, because reading and writing
.leo files handles @auto nodes well enough. However, you can use the
read-at-auto-nodes command to update @auto nodes without having to reload the
.leo file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070809141529">Leo performs several checks to ensure that the result of importing an external
file will be equivalent to the file that writing the @auto tree would produce.

These checks can produces **errors** or **warnings**. Errors indicate a
potentially serious problem. Leo inserts an @ignore directive in the @auto tree
if any error is found. This @ignore directive prevents the @auto tree from
modifying the external file. If you @ignore directive, a later write of the
@auto tree will attempt to fix the problems that gave rise to the errors. There
are no guarantees however.

**Strict languages** are languages like Python for which leading whitespace is
especially significant. Before importing a file for a strict language, Leo
**regularizes** the leading whitespace of all lines of the original source file.
That is, Leo converts blanks to tabs or tabs to blanks depending on the value of
the @tabwidth directive in effect for the @auto node. Leo cannot guarantee to
reproduce the original source file exactly if problems are discovered while
regularizing leading whitespace.

After importing a file, Leo verifies that writing the @auto node would create
the same file as the original file. For strict languages, the comparison must be
exact, or nearly so. For non-strict languages, differences in leading whitespace
generate warnings, not errors.

File comparison mismatches can arise for several reasons:

1. Bugs in the import parsers. Please report any suspected bugs immediately.

2. Underindented lines in classes, methods or functions in strict languages. An
   **underindented line** is a line that is indented less then the starting line
   of the class, method or function in which it appears. Leo outlines can not
   represent such lines exactly: every line of node implicitly has at least the
   indentation of any unindented line of the node.

Leo will issue a warning (not an error) for underindented Python comment lines.
Such lines can not change the meaning of Python programs.</t>

What's New in Leo 4.4.4
##########################################

Leo 4.4.4 contains many important features originally planned for later releases.
The highlights of Leo 4.4.4:

- **The Great Graph Aha**:
  A Leo outline doesn't have to *be* an arbitrary graph in order to *represent* an arbitrary graph.

  That is, simple scripts allow Leo outlines to represent arbitrary
  directed graphs. There is no need for a separate 'graph world'. The graphed.py
  plugin is a direct result of this Aha. It allows you to create general graphs
  from Leo outlines.

- Support for **@auto nodes**.  Such nodes allow people to collaborate using Leo
  without inserting Leo sentinels in the files Leo generates.

- **@menus trees** in settings files create all of Leo's menus.  It is now dead
  easy to make Leo's menus look the way you want.

- **@buttons trees** in settings files create common @button nodes created in all
  Leo outlines.

- A new, faster, **colorizer plugin** replaces the __jEdit_colorizer__ plugin.

- New commands for **resolving cvs conflicts**.

- Leo's core is now compatible with jython.

  were general graphs. It is still early days for this exciting plugin.

- The threading_colorizer plugin replaces the __jEdit_colorizer__ plugin. This
  plugin features an elegant new algorithm that has much better performance and
  eliminates almost all flash.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070809145744.7">- See the release notes for a list of bugs fixed in Leo 4.4.4.

- Added the 'clear-all-marks' hook.

- Added button font setting. See the node: "@settings--&gt;Fonts--&gt;@font button font" in leoSettings.leo.

- Plugins and scripts may call the c.frame.canvas.createCanvas method to create a
  log tab containing a Tk.Canvas widget. Here is an example script::

    log = c.frame.log ; tag = 'my-canvas'
    w = log.canvasDict.get(tag)
    if not w:
        w = log.createCanvas(tag)
        w.configure(bg='yellow')
    log.selectTab(tag)

- Improved the yank and yank-pop commands and added @bool add_ws_to_kill_ring setting.

- Improved the debug command: it now adds the following code to the beginning of debug scripts::

    class G:
        def es(s,c=None):
          pass
    g = G()

- Added the @bool rst3 strip_at_file_prefixes setting.

- Added the g.app.inBridge ivar.

- Added @bool big_outline_pane setting. False (legacy): Top pane contains outline and log panes.
  True: Top pane contains only the outline pane.  Bottom pane contains body and log panes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070814090306">@auto trees allow people to use Leo in collaborative environments without using
sentinels in the files Leo generates. In contrast to @nosent, @auto trees can
change when the corresponding file changes outside of Leo.

Leo will automatically recreate (import) all @auto trees when reading a .leo
file, and will write all dirty @auto trees when saving a .leo file. There are
two exceptions to this statement:

1. Leo will never read (import) or write an @auto tree if
the root @auto tree is under the influence of an @ignore directive.

2. Saving a .leo file does not save @auto nodes if:

a) they haven't been changed or,

b) they do not contain a **significant** amount of information. An @auto tree
   contains a significant amount of information if it has  children or if the
   root node contains more than 10 characters.

Leo creates @auto trees by parsing the corresponding external file. Parsers
create descendant nodes of the @auto tree: one node for each class, method and
function in the external file.

Parsers presently exist for C, elisp, Java, Javascript, Pascal, PHP, Python and xml. Leo
determines the language using the file's extension.  Notes:

- If no parser exists for a language, the entire body of the external file is
  copied to the body of the @auto node.

- Javascript regexps that look like section references cause problems, but that
  can not be helped.

- Use the @data import_xml_tags setting in leoSettings.leo to specify the xml
  tags that create outline nodes. By default, the **organizer tags** are html,
  body, head, and div.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070814090306.2">Leo performs several checks to ensure that the result of importing an external
file will be equivalent to the file that writing the @auto tree would produce.

These checks can produces **errors** or **warnings**. Errors indicate a
potentially serious problem. Leo inserts an @ignore directive in the @auto tree
if any error is found. This @ignore directive prevents the @auto tree from
modifying the external file. If you @ignore directive, a later write of the
@auto tree will attempt to fix the problems that gave rise to the errors. There
are no guarantees however.

Before importing a file, Leo **regularizes** the leading whitespace of all lines
of the original source file. That is, Leo converts blanks to tabs or tabs to
blanks depending on the value of the @tabwidth directive in effect for the @auto
node. Leo also checks that the indentation of any non-blank line is not a
multiple of the indentation specified by the @tabwidth directive in effect for
the @auto node.

Leo cannot guarantee to reproduce the original source file exactly if problems
are discovered while regularizing leading whitespace. **Strict languages** are
languages such as Python for which leading whitespace must be preserved exactly
as it appears in the original source file. Problems during regularizing generate
errors for strict languages and warnings for non-strict languages.

After importing a file, Leo verifies that writing the @auto node would create
*exactly* the same file as the original file. Such file comparison mismatches
generate errors unless the problem involves only leading whitespace for
non-strict languages. Whenever a mismatch occurs the first non-matching line is
printed.

File comparison mismatches can arise for several reasons:

1. Bugs in the import parsers. Please report any suspected bugs immediately.

2. Underindented lines in classes, methods or function. An **underindented
   line** is a line that is indented less then the starting line of the class,
   method or function in which it appears. Leo outlines can not represent such
   lines exactly: every line of node implicitly has at least the indentation of
   any unindented line of the node.

The body text of the @enabled-plugins node contains a list of enabled plugins.
Notes:

- Leo attempts to load all plugins every time an @enabled-plugins node is seen.
   If the plugin has already been loaded, Leo silently ignores the request to
   re-enable the plugin. Leo never attempts to disable a plugin while processing
   enabled plugin strings. Thus, plugins enabled in an @enabled-plugins node in
   leoSettings.leo *will* be enabled regardless of the contents of any other
   @enabled-plugins node.

- g.app.gui.getEnabledPlugins contains the last value last processed
   @enabled-plugins node.

<t tx="ekr.20070816092449">Question and answer from plumloco.

Add the equivalent of::

    import sys 
    leocore = "path/to/leo/core" 
    if leocore not in sys.path: sys.path.append(leocore) 
    import leo.core.leoBridge as leoBridge

at the head of each file that uses leoBridge.

The problem is not importing leoBridge itself but (if I use 'from leo.core') the
importing of plugins, who get a different leoGlobals from leoBridge, without
g.app etc, and so do not work if they rely on dynamic values in g.etc.

&gt; Why can't you simply add leo/core to sys.path in sitecustomize.py?  

Putting leo\core on the python path as you suggest would put forty python modules
in the global module namespace for all python programs when I want just one.
Also, I have a safe working copy of leo and a cvs/testing version. I would wish
to test any programs against the testing version while using the working
version, but both /core directories can't be exposed at the same time.

&gt; Do you need plugins while running from the leoBridge? 

Afraid so, at least the rst3 plugin. The solution I am using now is to place::

    sys.modules['leoGlobals'] = leoGlobals  

in leoBridge after import leo.core.leoGlobals as leoGlobals

This allows my scripts
to be portable over the several computers/platforms I need to use them on, and
makes testing scripts against multiple leo versions easy. It does mean that my
scripts are not portable to other leo users but that is not likely to be a
problem.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20070915101157.168">When saving a .leo file, Leo now *reads* an @auto node if

1) the external file exists,
2) an 'insignificant' amount of data exists in the @auto tree, and
3)the @auto node has not been read previously.

This promises to fix some quite awkward use cases.

The 'perfect import' code now is a bit more relaxed, especially for 'non-strict'
languages (all languages except Python):

- Leo leaves leading whitespace alone for non-strict languages.

- Leo complains about intermixed tabs and blanks in leading whitespace only for
strict languages.

- Leo ignores leading whitespace in the perfect import tests for non-strict
languages.

These changes mean that Leo might change a external file if such a change occurs
only in leading whitespace in a non-strict language.</t>

A softish bug, but the use of findNodeInTree() in the UNL code can 
take you to the wrong place if more than one node in the tree has 
the same headString.  Patch below - can still go wrong if more than 
one sibling has the same name, but the UNL system doesn't have a 
solution for that.

An observation - the UNL jumping code will drop you as far down the 
path as it gets, i.e. you're moved to the last node that was one the 
path, even if the path ends before the last part of the UNL is 
reached.  This is ok, i.e. "this is as far as I could follow the 
UNL", the alternative would be to not move at all if the whole UNL 
can't be followed.

<t tx="ekr.20070920092716">The so-called resolve-cvs-conflict project has resolved itself into small,
easily understood commands.

The **read-file-into-node** command prompts for a filename, and creates an node
whose headline is @read-file-into-node &lt;filename&gt; and whose body text is the
entire contents of the file.

The **write-file-from-node** command writes the body text of the selected not to a file.
If the headline of the presently selected node starts with @read-file-into-node
the command use the filename that follows in the headline. Otherwise, the
command prompts for a filename.

When a cvs conflict occurs, the user will:

- read the file into a node using the read-file-into-node command,

- fix the conflict, as with any other editor, and

- write the file with the write-file-from-node command.

Any file can be fixed in this way, including external files and .leo files. The
only complication is that the user must not change sentinel lines. Two new
commands check the contents of a node: The **check-derived-file** and
**check-leo-file** commands tell whether a trial read of the presently selected
node can be done successfully. The check-derived-file command assumes the body
text is a external file; the check-leo-file command assumes the body text is an
entire .leo file.

The **compare-leo-outlines** command prompts for another (presumably similar)
.leo file that will be compared with the presently selected outline file (main
window). It then creates clones of all inserted, deleted and changed nodes.</t>

- Nested @menu nodes contain submenus.

- The command name follows @item. If the body text of an @item node exists, this
  body text is the menu name. Otherwise, the menu name is the command name.
  However, if the command name starts with a '*', hyphens are removed from the
  menu name.

- Menu names and command names may contain a single ampersand (&amp;). If present,

<t tx="ekr.20071004103659">The Great Graph Aha is:

A Leo outline doesn't have to *be* an arbitrary graph in order to *represent* an arbitrary graph.

So the graph world is unnecessary because we can use Leo nodes and trees as data
to other graphing packages.** That is, Python scripts can build arbitrary graphs
using Leo's existing nodes and trees. And Python scripts can manipulate those
graphs. And Python scripts could do the reverse: manipulate the Leo outline by
traversing general graphs. So there is no need to complicate Leo's fundamental
data structures. Hurray! Instead, we build on the strengths of already existing
graphing packages.

The Great Graph Aha created the opportunity for immediate action:

1. test.leo contains the essential scripts to implement graphs in Leo files.
   These short, simple, self-contained, easily modifiable scripts make possible
   everything ever envisaged by the (now-defunct) graph world project::

    leo2graph: convert a normal Leo tree to a NetworkX graph. 
    at-graph2graph: convert an @graph tree to a NetworkX graph. 
    at-networkx2graph: convert an @networkx tree to a NetworkX graph 
    at-networkx2at-graph: create an @graph tree from an @networkx tree.

2. The graphed plugin allows users to manipulate parts of Leo outlines as if
they were general graphs. It is still early days for this exciting plugin.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20071004110818">Leo creates its menus from the @menu and @item nodes in the @menus tree. Within
@menus trees, @menu nodes create menus and @item nodes create menu items.

The menu name always follows @menu. If the menu name is 'Plugins', Leo will
create the Plugins menu and populate the menu by calling the
'create-optional-menus' hook. This creates the Plugins menu as usual. Nested
@menu nodes define submenus.

The command name follows @item. If the body text of an @item node exists, this
body text is the menu name. Otherwise, the menu name is the command name.
However, if the command name starts with a '*', hyphens are removed from the
menu name. Menu names and command names may contain a single ampersand (&amp;). If
present, the following character is underlined in the name. If the command name
in an @item node is just a hyphen (-), the item represents a menu separator.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20071021101506">Hurray--these are no longer needed.

The following methods exist for the convenience of plugins.

**g.enableIdleTimeHook(idleTimeDelay=100)**

Enables the "idle" hook. Afterwards, Leo will call the "idle" hook approximately every idleTimeDelay milliseconds.
Leo will continue to call the "idle" hook periodically until disableIdleTimeHook is called.

**g.disableIdleTimeHook()**

Disables the "idle" hook.


**c.frame.menu.createMenuItemsFromTable (self,menuName,table,openWith=0)**

This method adds items to the menu whose name is menuName.
The table argument describes the entries to be created.
This table is a sequence of items of the form (name,None,command):

- name is the command name.
- None was a shortcut in previous versions of Leo, but shortcuts for user-defined commands
  should now be defined in @shortcuts nodes.
- command is the routine to execute when the menu item is selected.
- An entry of the form ("-",None,None) creates a separator line between menu items.


For example::

    table =
        ("Toggle Active Pane",None,self.OnToggleActivePane),
        ("-",None,None),
        ("Toggle Split Direction",None,self.OnToggleSplitDirection))
    c.frame.menu.createMenuItemsFromTable("Window",table)

If the openWith keyword argument is 1 the items are added to a submenu of the Open With menu.
However, it will be more convenient to use the createOpenWithMenuFromTable method to create the Open With menu.

**c.frame.menu.createNewMenu (self,menuName,parentName="top")**

This method creates a new menu:

- menuName is the name of the menu to be created.
- parentName is the name of the parent menu, or "top" if the menu is to created in the menu bar.

This method returns the menu object that was created, or None if there was a problem.
Your code need not remember the value returned by this method.  Instead, your code will refer to menus by name.

**c.frame.menu.createOpenWithMenuFromTable (self,table)**

This method adds items to submenu of the Open With menu item in the File menu.
The table argument describes the entries to be created.
This table is a sequence of items of the form (name,shortcut,data):

- name is the command name
- shortcut is the shortcut, or None to indicate no shortcut.
- data is a tuple of the form (command,arg,ext)
- command is one of "os.system", "os.startfile", "os.spawnl", "os.spawnv" or "exec".
- arg is an argument to be passed to the given command.
- ext is a file extension or None.

When the user selects the Open With item corresponding to the table item Leo executes command(arg).
If ext is not None, the temp file has the given extension.
Otherwise, Leo computes an extension based on what @language directive is in effect.
For example::

    table = (
        ("Idle",   "Alt+Shift+I",("os.system",idle_arg,".py")),
        ("Word",   "Alt+Shift+W",("os.startfile",None,".doc")),
        ("Wordpad","Alt+Shift+T",("os.startfile",None,".txt")))

    top().frame.createOpenWithMenuFromTable(table)

**c.frame.menu.deleteMenu (self,menuName)**

Deletes the menu whose name is given, including all entries in the menu.

**c.frame.menu.deleteMenuItem (self,itemName,menuName="top")**

Deletes the item whose name is itemName from the menu whose name is menuName.
To delete a menu in the menubar, specify menuName="top".

**c.frame.menu.setRealMenuNamesFromTable(table)**

Translates names of menus and menu items into another language.  For example::

    table = (
        ("Help", "&amp;Aide"),
        ("About Leo...", "Au &amp;sujet de Leo..."),
        ("Online Home Page", "&amp;Page d'Accueil en ligne"),
        ("Open Online Tutorial", "Ouvrir &amp;Tutoriel en ligne"),
        ("Open LeoDocs.leo", "Ouvrir Leo&amp;Docs.leo"),
        ("Open LeoConfig.leo", "Ouvrir Leo&amp;Config.leo"),
        ("Apply Settings", "Appliquer les &amp;Réglages"),
    )

    c.frame.menu.setRealMenuNamesFromTable(table)</t>
<t tx="ekr.20071021102946">Two methods in leoGlobals.py allow scripts and plugins to enable and disable 'idle' events.

Leo will continue to call the "idle" hook periodically until disableIdleTimeHook is called.

I like doctests, often debug with g.es()
statements, and open winpdb to examine what's
going on.

I've a small patch to the debug command
leoEditCommands.py--&gt;debugCommandsClass--&gt;debug
to simplify this.

The patch writes the following to the beginning of
the script being debugged;

class G:
def es(s,c=None):
  pass
g = G()

This makes the g.es() statements legal.

The patch also checks for doctests in the script,
and if found, converts them to regular code.

A node containing;

&gt;&gt;&gt; import inspect, sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; insp = sys.modules['inspect']
&gt;&gt;&gt; print insp.__name__
inspect
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.es(dir(insp))

can be run as a doctest;
&lt;alt x&gt; dt
(if the dtest.py plugin is active)

or sent to winpdb;
&lt;alt x&gt; debug

The patch doesn't change the handling of regular scripts.

It goes right after;
if not winpdb: return

#check for doctest examples
try:
    import doctest
    parser = doctest.DocTestParser()
    examples = parser.get_examples(script)

    # if this is doctest, extract the examples as a script
    if len(examples) &gt; 0:
        script = doctest.script_from_examples(script)

except ImportError:
    pass

# special case; debug code may include g.es("info string")
# insert code fragment to make this expression legal outside Leo

Leo 4.4.4 beta 4 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

This beta 4 version fixes all bugs reported against Leo 4.4.4 beta 3.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

Leo 4.4.4 contains many important features originally planned for later releases.

The highlights of Leo 4.4.4:
----------------------------

- The Great Graph Aha (tm): simple scripts allow Leo outlines to represent
  arbitrary directed graphs. There is no need for a separate 'graph world'. The
  graphed.py plugin is a direct result of this Aha. The graphed.py plugin allows
  you to create general graphs from Leo outlines.
  
- @menus trees in settings files create all of Leo's menus.  It is now dead
  easy to make Leo's menus look the way you want.

- @buttons trees in settings files create common @button nodes created in all
  Leo outlines.

- @auto nodes eliminate sentinels in external files, thereby allowing people to
  collaborate using Leo more easily. **Warning**: for now, please make backup
  copies of files imported with @auto.
  
- New commands for resolving cvs conflicts.

- A threading_colorizer plugin replaces the __jEdit_colorizer__ plugin.
  This plugin features much better performance and a new, elegant algorithm.
  
- Leo is now compatible with jython.

- Better support for icons in headlines.

- The usual assortment of bug fixes and other minor improvements.

change Python's default encoding to something other than 'ascii'. To do this,

The atFile read logic only **adds** nodes, it never deletes nodes. Thus,
the 'changed2' node 'survived' the atFile read logic. The 'changed2' node became
a 'vampire' node that couldn't be killed.

The fix will require some care. The present atFile.read logic is robust because
it *doesn't* delete nodes. I suspect the solutions will be as follows:

A. The atFile.read code can not delete the subtree of @thin nodes initially,
because it doesn't know whether there will be read errors later. If there are
read errors absolutely nothing must change. This ensures that read errors never
destroy information.

B. A new post-pass will look for vampire nodes: nodes that were not actually
read from the external file. I think (but haven't proven) that all descendants of
vampire nodes are also vampire nodes. If that is so the post-pass will simply
delete vampire nodes without worrying about whether they have descendants.

Bah - I just now looked at it closely enough to realize it's the evil
pickled Tk classes in cleo uAs.  So I don't know whether you want to
fix that or not, it makes sense Leo would read the file specified on
the command line before Tk is initialized - if it's just scanning for
settings maybe it could catch and ignore failed uA reads at that time?

At some point I want to take pickled Tk vars out of cleo, I was

An argument I'm always having with leo has to do with its conversion of file
paths to 'absolute' forms.

In the file browser I select '/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo'.
Leo reinterprets this as '/media/hda2/usr1/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo'

Then I switch machines, and while
'/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo' would still be valid,
'/media/hda2/usr1/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo' isn't - on the other machine it
would be '/media/hdb1/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo'.

I end up with the two entries in recent files, having to identify the right one.

If the Tk dialog is returning '/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo', which I assume it is
because that's what it's displaying, I wish leo would use and store that.

I have clones that traverse chapters.

Given the following Chapters:

&gt; Main
&gt; Big Picture
&gt; Smaller Chunk

I have in Main, my organization, with my group in it.  It's also cloned around
all the other views (really, everything starts in the Big Picture).

This is the layout of my clone:

1:  Chapter:Main &gt; me
2:  Chapter:Main &gt; MyOrg &gt; me
3:  Chapter:Big Picture &gt; CEO &gt; Some Big Honcho &gt; MyOrg &gt; me
4:  Chapter:Smaller Chunk &gt; Some Big Honcho &gt; MyOrg &gt; me

If I Go-To-Next-Clone  (ALT-N) from (1), focus will move to the selected node
in Chapter:Main, namely (2).

So here's the issue: 

Let each successive line below represent a starting focus, and the next line
the node that ALT-N selects.  If focus changes in the Outline pane (including
Chapter pane change) to match the Node, that case is marked with [f] - a successful
focus transition.

The issue are the lines w/o [f];  Here's a couple of test runs.

1: [f] (starting node / focus)
2: [f]
3:
4:
1: [f]

Next test:

3: [f]
1: [f]
1: [f]
4:
3:
1: [f]

Next test:

4: [f]
3:
1: [f]
2: [f]
4:
3:
1: [f]
2: [f]
... and so on...

In cases with NO [f], the outline pane seems moved to the "end", but no node
selected.

Not a show stopper, but a bug nonetheless.

<t tx="ekr.20071210094621">This following is adapted from Terry Brown's entry in Leo's wiki.

You can not just run leoBridge from Leo, because the leoBridge module is design
to run a separate copy of Leo. However, it is possible to run leoBridge from a
separate process. That turned out to be more, um, interesting than anticipated,
so I'm recording the results here.

The idea is that script A running in Leo (i.e. in a regular GUI Leo session)
calls script B through subprocess.Popen(), script B uses LeoBridge to do
something (parse unloaded Leo files), and returns the result to script A.
Passing the result back via the clipboard seemed like a possibility, but
XWindows / tcl/tk clipboard madness being what it is, that didn't seem to work.

First trick, calling script B from script A::

    import subprocess
    p = subprocess.Popen(('python',
        path_to_script_B,
        parameter_for_script_B,),
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        env={'PYTHONPATH': g.app.loadDir,'USER': g.app.leoID},
    )
    p.wait()

Setting PYTHONPATH in the environment seemed like the easiest way to let
script B find leoBridge.py (which it needs to import).  But by setting the
env parameter you limit script B's environment to be **only** PYTHONPATH,
which causes leoBridge to fail because, in unix at least, it depends
on USER in the environment.  So you need to pass that through too.

Now, because passing stuff back on the clipboard seems unreliable, at least
in XWindows, script B passes results back to script A via stdout (print),
but there's some Leo initialization chatter you want to avoid.  So put a
sentinel, 'START_CLIPBOARD', in the output, and collect it like this::

    response = p.stdout.readlines()
    while response and 'START_CLIPBOARD' not in response[0]:
        del response[0]
    del response[0]  # delete the sentinel as well
    response = ''.join(response)

This is the basic mechanism.  What I *actually* wanted to do was have script
B generate a branch of nodes and pass that back to script A for insertion in
the tree script A is running in.  That's relatively easy if you use::

    c.setCurrentPosition(pos_of_branch_to_return)
    c.copyOutline()
    print '&lt;!-- START_CLIPBOARD --&gt;'
    print g.app.gui.getTextFromClipboard()
    print '&lt;!-- END_CLIPBOARD --&gt;'

at the end of script B, and back in script A, after you've rebuilt
`response` as shown above, just::

    g.app.gui.replaceClipboardWith(response)
    c.pasteOutline()</t>

<t tx="ekr.20071217092203.138">The patch attached against leoConfig.py (current CVS) adds a machine
specific config file to the config files Leo loads.

I synchronize files between multiple (3) machines. This means I can't
use different myLeoSettings files on each.

Tk fonts are screen dpi sensitive.  But (in Linux at least)
Tk's attempts to switch a font you picked to something equivalent at a
different dpi always result in a font that looks terrible.

So every time I switch machines I edit ~/myLeoSettings.leo to move the
font defs I picked for the current machine to the bottom of the body
text for the appropriate settings node, and then restart Leo.

This patch means I don't have to do that any more.  I'm sure there are
other uses for it.  Python doesn't seem to have a generic machine name
finding function, hence the sequence of alternatives.</t>

- There was a horrendous bug in the match_seq_regexp matcher which could cause the colorizer to loop.
- There was another horrendous bug in match_regexp_helper that cause spurious matches.
- Added some more defensive code to have the colorizer recover more gracefully in this case. 
- The jedit2py script was not associating regexp rules whose regex starts with
  '\' with the proper character. The proper character is the hash_char
  character, not the '\' character. As a result, regexp's that start with '\'
  never got matched.

Chapter 21: IPython and Leo
############################################################

.. _`run Leo in a console window`: install.html#running-leo-from-a-console-window

Leo's ipython plugin provides two-way communication (a bridge) between Leo and
IPython: you can run Leo scripts from IPython, and IPython scripts from Leo. To
use this plugin, you must `run Leo in a console window`_. When this plugin is
enabled, Leo's start-ipython command starts IPython_ in this console.

Remarkably, Leo and IPython run simultaneously in the same process,
yet their separate event loops do not interfere with each other.
Scripts run from IPython *immediately* change Leo,
*exactly* as if the script were run from Leo.
Conversely, scripts run from Leo *immediately* affect the IPython interpreter.
As a result, Leo might be considered an `IPython Notebook`_.

The bridge between Leo and IPython is powerful because it is simple. Indeed,

1. **You can run any IPython script from Leo**.
On the Leo side, a single statement::

    ip = IPython.ipapi.get()

assigns ip to IPython's _ip variable. The ip variable allows scripts running in
Leo to do *anything* that an IPython script can do.

2. **You can run any Leo script from IPython**. 
The ipython plugin injects a single object named '_leo' into the IPython namespace. 
IPython scripts access Leo's c and g objects as
follows::

    c,g = _leo.c, _leo.g

The c and g variables allow scripts running in IPython to do *anything* that a
Leo script can do. 

This is basically everything that is required for IPython-Leo interaction.
However, you probably wont use 'c' and 'g' directly, but use a series of
convenience wrappers described in this document that make interactive work
painless and powerful.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080204100523">This plugin creates an instance of the **ipythonController** class for each Leo
window. The ipythonController objects manage a singleton instance of IPython's
IPShellEmbed class. See http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/manual/node9.html. Creating
this singleton instance starts IPython running in the console from which Leo was
run. As mentioned in the introduction, Leo and IPython appear to run
simultaneously. Their event loops do not interfere with each other.

The term **startup time** refers to the time that the singleton IPython instance is created.

Initializing Leo from IPython is easier than initializing IPython from Leo.
Indeed, the start-ipython command typically blocks and never returns, so it is not possible
to schedule a Leo script to be run after the start-ipython command returns.
Instead, it will typically be more convenient to use IPython's normal facilities to
schedule a script that initializes Leo when IPython starts.

The start-ipython command starts IPython running in the console and injects leox, a
**Leo Interface Object** into IPython's user namespace.
Using the leox object, IPython scripts can gain access to Leo's c and g variables::

    c,g = leox.c,leox.g

Thus, IPython scripts can do *anything* that can be done in Leo.
See `Scripting Leo from IPython`_ for full details.

Conversely, Leo scripts can gain access to IPython's _ip variable::

    ip = c.ipythonController.ip

Thus, Leo scripts can do *anything* that can be done in IPython.
See `Scripting IPython from Leo`_ for full details.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080204100523.1">This plugin creates the following Leo commands commands:

- The start-ipython command starts the singleton IPython instance running in the
  console and injects a Leo Interface Object into IPython's user namespace.
  **Run the start-ipython command before running the other commands**.


  **Important**: The start-ipython command blocks. That is, the command does not
  finish execution until IPython exits. In a typical workflow, IPython exits
  after Leo does, so the the start-ipython command *never* completes.

  Remarkably, this does not affect Leo's main loop: Leo itself does not block.
  However, because the start-ipython command blocks, it is not possible for the
  command to do any follow up initialization of IPython. In practice, this does
  not matter, because IPython provides several ways of executing scripts on
  startup. In short, it is often more convenient to initialize Leo from IPython
  than to initialize IPython from Leo.

- The push-to-ipython command pushes data to IPython.
  By default, it executes the body text of the presently
  selected node in IPython.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080204100523.2">Just as c and g provide full access to all aspects of Leo,
IPython's _ip var (and _ip.IP) provide full access of all of IPython's internals.
See extensionAPI_ for details.
The following script sets ip to IPython's _ip var::

    ip = c.ipythonController.ip # set ip to IPython's _ip var.

With ip defined as above, IPython scripts **running in Leo**
can do anything that a script running in IPython can do.

Leo scripts can simulate this plugins's minibuffer commands as follows.

To simulate the start-ipython command::

    x = c.ipythonController
    if x and not x.started(): x.startIPython()

To simulate the push-to-ipython command::

    x = c.ipythonController
    if x and x.started(): x.pushToIPython()

To run a given script in IPython::

    x = c.ipythonController
    if x and x.started(): x.pushToIPython(script=script)
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080204100523.3"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20080205080801">The start-ipython command injects the leox object into IPython's
user namespace.
The c and g ivars of the leox object are
the leoGlobals module and
the commander of the Leo outline that created the IPython shell, respectively.
Thus scripts **running in IPython** can do *anything* a Leo script can do.
For, such scripts can insert and delete nodes in Leo outlines.
The changes will become visible as soon as the script (running in IPython)
redraws the screen.

See `Chapter 7\: Scripting Leo with Python`_ for full details about how to script
Leo.  The following are merely examples about what can be done from IPython.
All these examples have been tested.

1. g.app.windowList is a list of all open Leo frames, so an IPython script can
   get a list of all commanders as follows::

    c,g = leox.c, leox.g
    commanders = [f.c for f in g.app.windowList]

2. IPython scripts can use the c.config object to get Leo settings.
   Suppose the body text of an @data
   ipython-bridge-startup-script setting contains a script to be executed when
   ipython starts up. An Ipython script can get that startup script as follows::

    c = leox.c
    startupScript = c.config.getData('ipython-bridge-startup-script')

3. Suppose the body text of an @data ipython-bridge-auto-open setting contains a
   list of .leo files to be automatically opened on startup. The following
   IPython script opens those files::

    c,g = leox.c, leox.g
    files = c.config.getData('ipython-bridge-auto-open-leo-files')
        # getData strips lines starting with '#'.
    for z in files:
        fileName = g.os_path_abspath(g.os_path_join(g.app.loadDir,z))
        g.openWithFileName(fileName, old_c=c)

It is easy to translate Leo's menu strings: simply create an @menus tree in
leoSettings.leo or myLeoSettings.leo that contains the translated menu names.

**New in Leo 4.4.8**:
Leo now contains support for translating messages sent to Leo's log:

- Rather than using an '_' function to denote strings to be translated, Leo's
  g.es and g.es_print functions translate "odd" (first, third, fifth) arguments,
  leaving "even" arguments untranslated. Keyword arguments, color, newline, etc.
  are never translated.

- All calls to g.es and g.es_print in Leo's core follow this convention.

- g.translateString does the actual translation using Python's `gettext`_ module.

- You can use the script in the node "@button print g.es stats" in scripts.leo
  to create catalogs of all scripts that need to be translated. Such catalogs
  are used by Python's gettext module. (This script was also used to check that
  the proper arguments to g.es and g.es_print were translated.)

Leo now contains minimal support for arguments to minibuffer commands.

- k.simulateCommand now puts arguments following the command name in k.givenArgs.
  Whitespace separates arguments.

- k.simulateCommand knows nothing about what the arguments mean. That is up to
  the individual commands.

- At present, only the following minibuffer commands now support k.givenArgs:
  open-outline, open-outline-by-name, save-file, save-file-as,
  save-file-as-unzipped and save-file-as-zipped.

  These commands use ''.join(k.givenArgs) to get the file name,
  which may cause problems if the file name contains whitespace.

- At present, the repeat-complex-command command does not support arguments.</t>

Eureka! I have just discovered an elegant solution to this problem!

The Aha is this:  we can create a "base" timestamp just *once*, when
the commander (i.e. the nodeIndices class) is created.  Thereafter,
code that writes gnx's simply calls nodeIndices.getIndex if the node
doesn't already have an index (or if indices are being reassigned in a
copied tree).

In other words, there is no need to be picky about timestamps, the
base timestamp will do, so there is no need to assign indices before
writing nodes!

I didn't see this before because computing timestamps is quite time
consuming.  In fact, we can't do so "on the fly".  That being so, the
old code computed the "new" timestamp once in assignFileIndices, which
lead me away from getting gnx's as needed.  But if there is only *one*
timestamp everything becomes easy.  There is no need to "batch" the
computation of gnx's.  In other words, timestamps don't have to be up-
to-the-second accurate.  They simply guarantee that two nodes (in a
particular outline) created by the *same* person can't collide.

This is the way it is written in "The Book". All calls to
assignFileIndices disappear!  All the code I wrote this morning that
remembers whether indices have been assigned disappears.  I'll keep a
do-nothing assignFileIndices around for compatibility with old
scripts.

This is *so* important.  It eliminates forever a source of serious
file write problems.  Furthermore, nodeIndices.getIndex becomes
substantially simpler. Even though the code was short, it implied some
very tricky assumptions.  Every time I read it I had to recreate why
it worked.  Those mental gymnastics should disappear.

A great day for Leo.

See http://docs.python.org/lib/os-procinfo.html for details.

Leo uses os.expanduser('~') to determine the HOME directory if no HOME environment variable exists.

Leo puts several files in your HOME/.leo directory:
.leoID.txt, .leoRecentFiles.txt, and myLeoSettings.leo.

<t tx="ekr.20080411111008.1">Leo ignores any subtree of an @settings tree whose headline starts with @ignore.

You can use several other kinds of nodes to cause Leo to ignore parts of  an @settings tree:

- @if *expression*

  A node whose headline starts with @if *expression* acts like an organizer node if the expression evaluates to True,    
  otherwise acts like an @ignore node.
  If the expression is empty the body text should contain a script that will be evaluated (in an empty context).

- @ifplatform *platform-name*

  Same as @if sys.platform == "platform-name": except that it isn't necessary to import sys.

- @ifhostname *hostA,!hostB*

  Evaluates to True iff: h=g.computeMachineName(); h==hostA and h!=hostB.
  The "!" version allows matching to every machineName except the given one
  to allow differing settings on only a few machines.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20080527063511.1">I had a need to figure out why a part of some python code I had written
was taking too long.

I pulled the code into LEO and the relevant part of the outline looked
something like this::

    + Main module
    -- Generate cryptographic key
    -- Hashing algorithm

etc. So I cloned just the segment I wanted to profile and pulled it under a new
section::

    + Main module
    -- [clone] Generate cryptographic key
    -- Hashing algorithm

    + Profiling Experiment
    -- [clone] Generate cryptographic key

And in the body of the "Profiling experiment", I used this code::

    code_under_here = """
    @others
    """

    from timeit import Timer
    t = Timer("print my_key_generator()", code_under_here)
    print t.timeit(number = 10)

And then I hit Control-B to execute the Profiling Experiment body. This
let me make adjustments to the code in the clone body and keep hitting
Control-B to execute the code with the timeit module to see immediately
if what I had done was making a difference.

The great thing about this was that I just used the LEO @others construct
to create a wrapper around the code and did not need to litter my code
with debug or profiling statements.  -- Kayvan</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080603124653.1">Many users will want to track the development version of Leo, in order to stay
on top of the latest features and bugfixes. Running the development version is
quite safe and easy, and it's also a requirement if you want to contribute to
Leo.

1. First, you need to get Bazaar (bzr) from http://bazaar-vcs.org. For windows
   users we recommend the standalone installer - the python installer may have
   problems pushing to Launchpad. Plain bzr installer only contains the command
   line version, so you might want to augment that with a friendly GUI - qbzr is
   recommended as it's the easiest one to install. It provides command like
   'bzr qlog', 'bzr qannotate' etc.

2. Get Leo from launchpad by doing::

    bzr branch lp:leo-editor

And that's it! You can run the launchLeo script (in the top-level branch directory) directly.
When you want to refresh the code with latest modifications from Launchpad, 'run bzr pull'.

If you make modifications to Leo (with the interest in sharing them with the Leo
community), you can check them in to your local branch by doing 'bzr checkin'.
Now, to actually request your changes to be merged to Leo trunk, you need a
Launchpad account with RSA keys in place. There is showmedo video about how to
accomplish this on Windows using puttygen and pageant at
http://showmedo.com/videos/video?name=1510070&amp;fromSeriesID=151.

After your Launchpad account is set up, go to
https://launchpad.net/leo-editor, choose Code tab -&gt; Register Branch, select
Branch type "Hosted" and fill in descriptive details about the branch. After
that, go to the branch home page from Code tab again, and copy-paste the push
command line to terminal. For example, for branch::

 https://code.launchpad.net/~leo-editor-team/leo-editor/mod_rclick

The push command is::

 bzr push bzr+ssh://my_name@bazaar.launchpad.net/~leo-editor-team/leo-editor/mod_rclick

You may wish to add --remember command line option to bzr push, to direct all
future pushes to that location. Then, you only need to execute 'bzr push'.

After your branch is pushed, you can email the Leo mailing list and request it
to be reviewed and merged to trunk.

- A major revision of Leo's node structures, compatible with so-called unified nodes.
- A major revision of Leo's key-handling code.  Most per-pane key bindings have been eliminated.
- A major revision of Leo's outline drawing and focus handling code.
  Calls to c.beginUpdate and c.endUpdate simply request later redrawing in c.outerUpdate.
- The beginning of usable vim-like bindings.  More support is coming.
- Many small improvements and bug fixes.

If you want more details, you can do what I did: do a clone-find-all for homeDir.

As for how the home directory is set, the code to do this is g.computeHomeDir.  We get the home directory with

home = os.getenv('HOME',default=None)

There are some mind-numbing details to be handled if there os.getenv does, in fact, return a directory.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080624093059.37">Leo suppresses marks, expansion state, orphan bits and current
position bits when writing fixed .leo files.  As a result, all nodes
will be collapsed and the root node will always be selected when Leo
opens a fixed .leo file.

When writing fixed .leo files, Leo writes fixed, immutable, reasonable
defaults for window size, position and body-outline ratio.
Specifically, width,height,left,top = 700,500,50,50 and the ratio is
0.5. These values are written so older versions of Leo can read fixed
files.

You make a file fixed by putting '@bool fixedWindow = True' in the
@settings tree of a particular .leo file.  The file will be fixed
after you save the file, reload the file, and save the file again.
Yes, this is clumsy, but it only has to be done once.  A toggle-fixed
file command doesn't seem that useful: using an @bool node is simple
and clear.

You can optionally specify the size and position on the screen of
fixed .leo files by putting an '@data fixedWindowPosition' node in the
@settings tree of myLeoSettings.leo or leoSettings.leo.  You should
**not** put such a node in the fixed .leo file itself--everyone who
opens the file would get that fixed position.

The body of the '@data fixedWindowPosition' node should contain
something like this:

# Must be four entries: width,height,left,top.
# Put this in myLeoSettings.leo, **not** in individual .leo files.

1200
800
50
50

Leo uses reasonable defaults for fixed .leo files if this node does
not exist, or contains something other than 4 numbers, one per line. </t>

<t tx="ekr.20080624093059.49">Leo Configuration:
    | The following configuration was used for all testing:
        @strings  top_level_unbound_key_action = command
        @bool stayInTreeAfterEditHeadline = True
        @bool stayInTreeAfterSelect = True
        @bool outline_pane_has_initial_focus = True

Leo's Panes:
    | A "pane" is a area of the screen containing a user interface
    | dedicated to supporting a common set of tasks.  Vi key mappings are
    | associated with the Outline pane, the Body pane, or to the Leo
    | program.  See the no pane (see "General Commands" below). (Outline
    | pane, Body pane)

Leo's Command/Insert States:
    Command state - Denoted by a blue background color (Outline,Body pane)
        | Keys are mapped to commands.
    Insert state - Denoted by a red background color (Outline,Body pane)
        | Keys pressed are inserted into the text.
    Grayed state - Denoted by a gray background color (Outline pane)
        | Keys pressed will cause the next node with a headline starting
        | with that key to be selected.  This "select node by first
        | character" feature is built into Leo. It is not part of the vi
        | support.
        | 
        | This state is intentionally avoided in the vi based outline key
        | mappings. If in the "Grayed" state, enter Ctrl-i to switch to the
        | "Command" state.  The "Grayed" state can be entered from the
        | outline's "Command" state by pressing the Ctrl-] key.

Leo's modes:
| Most vi commands are implemented using Leo's "mode" functionality.
| Modes beginning with "vi-" denote a vi command for the body pane.
| Modes beginning with "tree-" denote a vi-like command for the outline.
| Modes beginning with "body-" denote outline commands that can be called
| from the body pane (and return focus back to the body pane)
| 
| Modes are used both for managing multi-key vi commands and for defining
| macros.
    
    Multi-key command modes:
    | Vi has many commands that require multiple keys to invoke.  Each key
    | accept the last in the command are assigned to a mode that, when
    | executed, maps the subsequent allowed keys in the command sequence.
    | The last key in the sequence is mapped directly to a Leo command or
    | to a "Macro" mode (see below). Any modes mapped to a key by another
    | mode are located in a child node of the mode node doing the mapping.
    | 
    | Example:
    |     dtw = Delete To the 'W' character (note the capital letters)
    |   The 'd' key is mapped to vi-delete-object
    |   vi-delete-object maps the 't' key to vi-delete-to-char
    |   vi-delete-to-char contains Leo commands to perform the vi command.

    Macros modes:
    | Most vi commands do not have an equivalent Leo command.  Instead, a
    | series of Leo commands must be issued to emulate the vi command.
    | The Leo commands needed to emulate a vi command are placed in a
    | single @mode node.

Code limitations:
    Current character:
    | Vi implementation normally use two different "current character"
    | designators depending on the current state.

        Insert state:
        | In the Insert state, a vertical bar is placed between two
        | characters to indicate where the next key will be inserted.
        | Leo's cursor is of this type.

        Command state: 
        | In the Command state, vi expects that the cursor is highlighting
        | a current character and provides commands to enter the insert
        | state or paste text either before or after that current
        | character.  Leo's vi emulation currently does not support a
        | "current character" cursor. As a result, inserting and pasting
        | before or after is replaced by inserting or pasting "at" the
        | current cursor location.  For example, the 'i' and 'a' command
        | are both mapped to enter the insert state at the current cursor
        | location.

    Conditional code execution:
    | No conditional command invocation exits.  Instead, conditional
    | branching is replace by setup commands that insure that, regardless
    | of current state, the command performs correctly.  For example,
    | Beginning-of-line command will go to previous line if called when
    | cursor is at beginning of line.  Vi requires that '|' always goes to
    | beginning of current line.  Problme is solved by issueing
    | forward-char command to insure cursor is moved off of the beginning
    | of the line before beginning-of-line command is issued.

    Commands requesting user input:
    | Commands getting user input must be the last command within the
    | mode.  See "Commands getting user input" in Problems section below.

    Edit headings using modes:
    | Commands modifying or selecting headline text do not work correctly
    | within a mode.  See "Editing headlines within modes" in Problems
    | section below.  This eliminates accurate implementation of vi's
    | delete/change/substitute/yank object commands.  Instead, the
    | commands are modified to only select text.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080624093059.5"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20080624093059.50">Binding numeric keys:
| Mapping a number to a command or mode prevents the number from being
| entered as text while in the insert state.

Binding '?' key:
| No response when key pressed.

Binding 'bksp' key:
| Binding 'bksp' key to back-char to move back a character in command mode
| prevents 'bksp' from deleting characters in text edit mode.

Commands getting user input:
| Commands requesting user input must be the last command executed.  These
| commands include: find-character and zap-to-character.

Editing headlines within modes:
| Text editing commands do not work within modes assigned to outline key
| mappings.

Undo command:
| The 'undo' command sometimes does not work when returning to a node's
| command mode.  Moving to another node fixes the problem.(i.e. delete-char, set-insert-state, ...)

Matching bracket command:
| Performs bracket matching on Body text when in node's headline command
| state.

Word definition:
| "Word" related commands determine boundries of a word differently.

Toggle case:
| Leo provides support for switching to upper or lower case but no method |
| exists to toggle between cases.

Find settings
| Leo commands only allow toggling of search settings.  If specific "set"
| and "clear" search setting commands were available then searches from the
| body pane could be restricted to the body pane and searches from the
| outline could be restricted to the outline.
Forward and backward sentences:
| Leo's forwardSentenceHelper and backSentenceHelper functions do not stop
| at empty lines nor do they skip over periods within words nor do they stop
| at sentences ending in non-periods nor do they stop at the end or
| beginning of the buffer.

Focus to Body pane:
| Leo functions exist which unconditionally set focus to the body pane
| regardless of the active pane.
    deleteTab() function:
        | Issuing "--&gt; exit-named-mode" calls "endMode" function which calls
        | "c.frame.log.deleteTab('Mode')" function which sets the focus to the
        | body pane.  

Displaying mode help:
| The "--&gt; mode-help" command displays all mapped keys using a capitol
| letter regardless of the actual binding.
    Recommendations:
    | To better support narrow tab cards, display the mode's label without
    | the "enter-" and "-mode" text and place key label before mode label.
    | Results in change from:
    |                enter-vi-delete-line-mode D
    |    enter-vi-delete-to-begin-of-word-mode B 
    | to:
    |    D : vi-delete-line
    |    B : vi-delete-to-begin-of-word</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080624093059.51">Yank vs. Yank
| A vi "yank" operation copies the selected text TO the clipboard.
| A Leo "yank" operation inserts text FROM the clipboard.

copy-text in modes:
| Leo's copy-text does not work within a mode.  As a result, all "copy to
| clipboard" capability is being implemented using kill-&lt;object&gt; command
| followed by a "yank" command.

paste-text in modes:
| paste-text in modes does not work.  Use Leo's "yank" instead.

delete-node does not copy node to clipboard:
| Issue copy-node command followed by delete-node</t>

Chapter 23: Eliminating sentinel lines with @shadow
############################################################

This chapter describes an important new feature that debuted in Leo 4.5 b2: @shadow trees.
These trees combine the benefits of @auto, @thin, @file and @nosent trees:

- The (public) files created by @shadow trees contain no sentinels, but
- Leo is able to update @shadow trees in the Leo outline based on changes made
  to public files outside of Leo.

@shadow trees are often useful for studying or editing source files from projects that don't use Leo. 
In such situations, it is convenient to import the @shadow tree from the (public) sources.
As discussed below, Leo can import @shadow trees automatically,
using the same algorithms used by `@auto trees`_.

The crucial ideas and algorithms underlying @shadow trees are the invention of Bernhard Mulder.

without Leo sentinels (markup) in comments in the source file. 

Leo's @file and @thin trees create external files containing comments called sentinels.
These sentinel lines allow Leo to recreate the outlines structure of @file and @thin trees.
Alas, many people and organizations find these added sentinel lines unacceptable.
@nosent nodes create external files without sentinels, but at a cost:
Leo can not update @nosent trees when the corresponding external file is changed outside of Leo.

@shadow trees provide a way around this dilemma.
When Leo saves an @shadow tree, it saves two copies of the tree:
a **public** file without sentinels, and a **private** file containing sentinels.
Using Bernhard Mulder's brilliant **update algorithm**,
Leo is able to update @shadow trees in the Leo outline based *solely* on changes to public files.

Leo writes private files to a subfolder of the folder containing the public file:
by default this folder is called .leo_shadow.
You can change the name of this folder using the @string shadow_subdir setting.
Note that private files need not be known to source code control systems such as bzr or cvs.

That's *almost* all there is to it.  The following sections discuss important details:

- How to create @shadow trees.
- How @shadow works.
- Why the update algorithm is sound.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080730212711.40">Suppose our @shadow tree is @shadow a.py. When Leo writes this tree it creates a
public file, a.py, and a private file, .leo_shadow/xa.p (or just xa.p for
short). Public files might can committed to a source code control system such as
cvs or bzr. Private files should *not* be known to cvs or bzr.

Now suppose a.py has been changed outside of Leo, say as the result of a bzr
merge. The corresponding private file, xa.p, will *not* have been changed.
(Private files should *never* change outside of Leo.

When Leo reads the *new* (and possibly updated) public file it does the
following:

1. Recreates the *old* public file by removing sentinels from the (unchanged!) *private* file.
2. Creates a set of diffs between the old and new *public* files.
3. Uses the diffs to create a new version of the *private* file.
4. Creates the @shadow tree using  the new *private* file.

**Important**: The update algorithm never changes sentinels. This means that the
update algorithm never inserts or deletes nodes. The user is responsible for
creating nodes to hold new lines, or for deleting nodes that become empty as the
result of deleting lines.

Step 3 is the clever part. To see all the details of how the algorithm works,
please study the x.propagate_changed_lines method in leoShadow.py. This code is
heavily commented.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080730212711.41">When writing an @shadow tree, Leo writes *two* files, a **public** file without
sentinels, and a **private** file (by default in the .leo_shadow subfolder)
containing sentinels. The primary sources for @shadow trees are the private
files, updated by changes to the public file.

When reading an @shadow tree, Leo will import the tree from the public file if
the private file does not exist. **Important**: just as for @auto, the following
exceptions apply:

1. Leo will never read (import) or write an @shadow tree if the @shadow tree is
   under the influence of an @ignore directive.

2. Saving a .leo file does not save @shadow nodes if:

  a) they haven't been changed or,

  b) they do not contain a **significant** amount of information. An @auto tree
     contains a significant amount of information if it has children or if the
     root node contains more than 10 characters.

Leo imports shadow trees by parsing the corresponding public file, exactly as is
done for @auto node. See the discussion of @auto above for details.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080730212711.42">The first step in creating an @shadow tree is to create a node whose headline is
@shadow *&lt;filename&gt;*. This is always safe, even if *&lt;filename&gt;* already
exists: Leo writes the @shadow tree to the public and private files only if the
@shadow tree contains a **significant** amount of information. An @shadow tree
contains a significant amount of information if it has children or if the @shadow node
node contains more than 10 characters, excluding Leo directives.

Thus, you can create an @shadow node and save your outline, regardless of whether the original file exists.
The next time Leo reads the @shadow node, Leo will **create** the entire @shadow tree
using the same logic as for `@auto trees`_.
You can cause Leo to read the @shadow node in two ways:
1) by closing and reloading the Leo outline or
2) by selecting the @shadow node and executing the File:Read/Write:Read @shadow Node command.

**Important**: Leo imports the private file into the @shadow tree only if
a) the public file exists and b) the private file does *not* exist.
Thus, Leo will import code into each @shadow node at most once.
After the first import, updates are made using the update algorithm.

**Note**: just as for @auto, Leo will never read (import) or write an @shadow tree if
the @shadow node is under the influence of an @ignore directive.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080730212711.44">Creates an external file containing sentinels. Thin exteral files contain all
information needed to recreate the @thin tree in the outline. The @all directive
is valid only in @thin trees, not @file trees. In a collaborative environment,
where a version control system is utilized and everyone can use Leo for editing,
@thin is the recommended way to hold most of the content.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080730212711.47">@auto trees allow people to use Leo in collaborative environments without using
sentinels in the files Leo generates. In contrast to @nosent, @auto trees can
change when the corresponding file changes outside of Leo.

Leo will automatically recreate (import) all @auto trees when reading a .leo
file, and will write all dirty @auto trees when saving a .leo file. There are
two exceptions to this statement:

1. Leo will never read (import) or write an @auto tree if
the root @auto tree is under the influence of an @ignore directive.

2. Saving a .leo file does not save @auto nodes if:

a) they haven't been changed or,

b) they do not contain a **significant** amount of information. An @auto tree
   contains a significant amount of information if it has  children or if the
   root node contains more than 10 characters.

Leo creates @auto trees by parsing the corresponding external file. Parsers
create descendant nodes of the @auto tree: one node for each class, method and
function in the external file.

Parsers presently exist for C, elisp, Java, Javascript, Pascal, PHP, Python and xml. Leo
determines the language using the file's extension.  Notes:

- If no parser exists for a language, the entire body of the external file is
  copied to the body of the @auto node.

- Javascript regexps that look like section references cause problems, but that
  can not be helped.

- Use the @data import_xml_tags setting in leoSettings.leo to specify the xml
  tags that create outline nodes. By default, the **organizer tags** are html,
  body, head, and div.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080730212711.51">The @root directive creates external files that are more flexible than @file, @thin, @shadow, etc.

- Sections may be defined anywhere within @root trees.
  Moreover, the @unit directive expands the scope of section definitions in @root trees
  so that a section may be referenced in several @root trees.

- The meaning of section definitions in @root trees are independent of their position within the tree.

However, this flexibility comes at a cost:

- @thin and @file trees use less markup than @root trees.
  In particular, the @others directive is valid only within @file and @thin trees.

- You must explicitly tangle and untangle @root trees using the Tangle and Untangle commands.

See `@root reference`_ for more details.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080730212711.52">There is one boundary case that the update algorithm can not resolve.
If a line is inserted at the boundary between nodes,
the updated algorithm can not determine whether the line should be inserted
at the end of one node of the start of the next node.

Happily, the inability of the update algorithm to distinguish between
these two cases **does not matter**, for three very important reasons:

1. No matter which choice is made, the *public* file that results is the same.
   **The choice doesn't matter**, so the update algorithm is completely and
   absolutely safe.

2. Leo reports any nodes that were changed as the result of the update
   algorithm. In essence, these reports are exactly the same as the reports Leo
   makes when @file or @thin trees were changed as the result of changes made
   externally to Leo. It is as easy for the user to review changes to @shadow
   trees as it is to review changes to @thin or @file trees.

3. Suppose the user moves a line from the end of one node to the beginning of
   the following node, or vice versa. Once the user saves the file, the
   *private* file records the location of the moved line. The next time the user
   reads the @shadow file, the line will *not* be subject to the update
   algorithm because the line has not been changed externally. The location of
   the line (on the boundary) will be completely determined and it will never
   need to be moved across the boundary.

Understanding these three reasons finally convinced me that @shadow could be made to work reliably.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080806211440.188">- Added support for @shadow files.
  This is a major breakthrough.
  See `Chapter 23`_ for full details.

- Added much improved support for vim bindings.

- Allow v.uA's in @thin and @shadow nodes.
  See http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/750bb3099090f5b
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080806211440.189">- The default settings for @shadow files are now located in leoSettings.leo in the node::

    @settings--&gt;File options--&gt;Shadow files

  The defaults for these settings are::

    @string shadow_prefix = x
    @string shadow_subdir = .leo_shadow

- Added support for @bool fixedWindow option. Leo suppresses marks, expansion
  state, orphan bits and current position bits when writing fixed .leo files. As
  a result, all nodes will be collapsed and the root node will always be
  selected when Leo opens a fixed .leo file.

  You can optionally specify the size and position on the screen of fixed .leo
  files by putting an '@data fixedWindowPosition' node in the
  @settings tree of myLeoSettings.leo or leoSettings.leo.  You should
  **not** put such a node in the fixed .leo file itself--everyone who
  opens the file would get that fixed position.

  The body of the '@data fixedWindowPosition' node should contain
  something like this::

    # Must be four entries: width,height,left,top.
    # Put this in myLeoSettings.leo, **not** in individual .leo files.

    1200
    800

- Added @bool cleo_color_ignore = True
  This determines whether cleo colors @ignore headlines. The default is True.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080806211440.253">- Leo now uses a sax-based parser to read .leo files.
  This makes it possible to extend Leo's file format without invalidating previous versions of Leo.

- Leo now supports the so-called 'Graph World'.
  When g.unified_nodes is True, Leo moves all information from tnodes into vnodes.

- Leo now uses a new key binding scheme.
  This allows substantially simpler key bindings. Indeed, most per-pane bindings
  have been eliminated.
  Added support for kill bindings.

- Leo is now an installable package.
  To make this work, Leo adds os.curdir to sys.path if needed on startup.

- Reorganized Leo's drawing and focus code.
  As a result, calls to c.beginUpdate and c.endUpdate are no longer needed.

- Leo is now ready for Python 3.x:
  Change most print statements to calls to g.pr.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080806211440.256">- Added g.Tracer class.  This is a Python 'debugger' that computes a call graph.
  To trace a function and its callers, put the following at the function's start::

    g.startTracer()

- The find-character command now finds characters across line boundaries.

- Set cwd in read/write commands. This affect the following commands:
  open, save, save-as, save-to, read-outline-only, read-file-into-node,
  write-file-from-node and all the import/export commands.

- Leo creates the .leo folder in the user's HOME directory, and puts several configuration files there.
  Leo looks for myLeoSettings.leo in HOME/.leo.
  Leo uses os.path.expanduser("~") if there is no home setting.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080813064908.2">In version 4.5, Leo changed to using a sax parser for .leo files. This can cause
problems if your .leo file contains invalid characters.
Bugs in previous versions of Leo permitted these bad characters to appear.

The sax parser complains that these characters are not valid in .xml files.
Remove these invalid characters as follows:

1. `run Leo in a console window`_, and load the .leo file.
   Near the bottom of the error message you will see a line like::

    SAXParseException: &lt;unknown&gt;:123:25: not well-formed (invalid token)

   This line reports a bad character at character 25 of line 123.

2. Open the .leo file in an external editor.
   The Scite editor, http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html,
   is a good choice because it clearly shows non-printing characters.
   Remove the invalid character, save the .leo file.

Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all invalid characters are gone.

<t tx="ekr.20080830082008.5">- The default settings for @shadow files are now located in leoSettings.leo in the node::

    @settings--&gt;File options--&gt;Shadow files
    
  The defaults for these settings are::

    @string shadow_prefix = x
    @string shadow_subdir = .leo_shadow

- Added support for @bool fixedWindow option. Leo suppresses marks, expansion
  state, orphan bits and current position bits when writing fixed .leo files. As
  a result, all nodes will be collapsed and the root node will always be
  selected when Leo opens a fixed .leo file.
  
  You can optionally specify the size and position on the screen of fixed .leo
  files by putting an '@data fixedWindowPosition' node in the
  @settings tree of myLeoSettings.leo or leoSettings.leo.  You should
  **not** put such a node in the fixed .leo file itself--everyone who
  opens the file would get that fixed position.

  The body of the '@data fixedWindowPosition' node should contain
  something like this::

    # Must be four entries: width,height,left,top.
    # Put this in myLeoSettings.leo, **not** in individual .leo files.

- Added @bool cleo_color_ignore = True
  This determines whether cleo colors @ignore headlines. The default is True.
  
- Added @bool suppress_import_parsing setting

<t tx="ekr.20080902080930.3">- Added support for @shadow files.
  This is a major breakthrough.
  See `Chapter 23`_ for full details.
  
- Added much improved support for vim bindings.

- Allow v.uA's in @thin and @shadow nodes.
  See http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/750bb3099090f5b
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080902080930.4">- Leo now uses a sax-based parser to read .leo files.
  This makes it possible to extend Leo's file format without invalidating previous versions of Leo.
  
- Leo now supports the so-called 'Graph World'.
  When g.unified_nodes is True, Leo moves all information from tnodes into vnodes.
  
- Leo now uses a new key binding scheme.
  This allows substantially simpler key bindings. Indeed, most per-pane bindings
  have been eliminated.
  Added support for kill bindings.
  
- Leo is now an installable package.
  To make this work, Leo adds os.curdir to sys.path if needed on startup.
  
- Reorganized Leo's drawing and focus code.
  As a result, calls to c.beginUpdate and c.endUpdate are no longer needed.
  
- Leo is now ready for Python 3.x:
  Change most print statements to calls to g.pr.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080902080930.5">- Added g.Tracer class.  This is a Python 'debugger' that computes a call graph.
  To trace a function and its callers, put the following at the function's start::

    g.startTracer()
  
- The find-character command now finds characters across line boundaries.

- Set cwd in read/write commands. This affect the following commands:
  open, save, save-as, save-to, read-outline-only, read-file-into-node,
  write-file-from-node and all the import/export commands.

- Added support for @args list for @button nodes.
  See the docstring for the mod_scripting plugin for details.
  
- Leo creates the .leo folder in the user's HOME directory, and puts several configuration files there.
  Leo looks for myLeoSettings.leo in HOME/.leo.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080902080930.6">- The default settings for @shadow files are now located in leoSettings.leo in the node::

    @settings--&gt;File options--&gt;Shadow files
    
  The defaults for these settings are::

    @string shadow_prefix = x
    @string shadow_subdir = .leo_shadow

- Added support for @bool fixedWindow option. Leo suppresses marks, expansion
  state, orphan bits and current position bits when writing fixed .leo files. As
  a result, all nodes will be collapsed and the root node will always be
  selected when Leo opens a fixed .leo file.
  
  You can optionally specify the size and position on the screen of fixed .leo
  files by putting an '@data fixedWindowPosition' node in the
  @settings tree of myLeoSettings.leo or leoSettings.leo.  You should
  **not** put such a node in the fixed .leo file itself--everyone who
  opens the file would get that fixed position.

  The body of the '@data fixedWindowPosition' node should contain
  something like this::

    # Must be four entries: width,height,left,top.
    # Put this in myLeoSettings.leo, **not** in individual .leo files.
    
    1200
    800
    50
    50

- Added @bool cleo_color_ignore = True
  This determines whether cleo colors @ignore headlines. The default is True.
  
- Added @bool suppress_import_parsing setting
  When True, @auto and @shadow import the entire file into a single node.</t>

for which python was not the top-most directory.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080922124033.1">The following code can be run from a script to get input from the user using the minibuffer::

    def getInput (event=None):

       stateName = 'get-input'
       k = c.k
       state = k.getState(stateName)

       if state == 0:
           k.setLabelBlue('Input: ',protect=True)
           k.getArg(event,stateName,1,getInput)
       else:
           k.clearState()
           g.es_print('input: %s' % k.arg)

    getInput()

Let's look at this in detail.  The lines::

    stateName = 'get-input'
    k = c.k
    state = k.getState(stateName)

define a state *name*, 'get-input', unique to this code.
k.getState returns the present state (an int) associated with this state.

When getInput() is first called, the state returned by k.getState will be 0,
so the following lines are executed::

    if state == 0:
        k.setLabelBlue('Input: ',protect=True)
        k.getArg(event,stateName,1,getInput)

These lines put a protected label in the minibuffer:
the user can't delete the label by backspacing.
getArg, and the rest of Leo's key handling code, take care of the extremely
complex details of handling key strokes in states.
The call to getArg never returns.
Instead, when the user has finished entering the input by typing &lt;Return&gt;
getArg calls getInput so that k.getState will return state 1, the value
passed as the third argument to k.getArg.
The following lines handle state 1::

    else:
        k.clearState()
        g.es_print('input: %s' % k.arg)

k.arg is the value returned by k.getArg.
This example code just prints the value of k.arg and clears the input state.

keys are directive names and whose values are the value in effect at position p.
For example::

    d = c.scanAllDirectives(p)
    g.es(g.dictToString(d))

In particular, d.get('path') returns the full, absolute path created by all
\@path directives that are in ancestors of node p. If p is any kind of @file node
(including @thin, @auto, @nosent, @shadow, etc.), the following script will
print the full path to the created file::

    path = d.get('path')

<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.10">The form of this node is::

    @menuat *&lt;path&gt;* *&lt;action&gt;* *[clipboard]*

The @menuat setting has 2-3 parameters in its head text, its children are @menu and
@item nodes as for the @menu setting.  @menuat modifies the menu tree created by @menus.
It is intended to be used in myLeoSettings.leo to modify the menu tree created
in leoSettings.leo. This allows you to change the menus without having to
re-create the entire menu tree from leoSettings.leo, and ensures you don't miss
out when new things are added in the @menus in leoSettings.leo, as you would if
you replaced the @menus in leoSettings.leo with one in myLeoSettings.leo.
@menuat should occur in a @settings tree, but not as a descendant of a @menus
tree. There is an example of the use of the
@menuat setting in the file .../leo/core/test/menuAtTest.leo.

The **path** argument specifies a target location in the menu tree as defined by
@menus and modified by earlier @menuat settings. The path takes the form
/entry1/entry2/entry3 where each entry is the name of a menu or item with all
text except a-z and 0-9 removed. Upper case letters are converted to lower case.
So for example to use the `Outline-&gt;Move-&gt;Move Down` menu item as a target, you
would specify a path as `/outline/move/movedown`.

The **action** argument specifies what the menu item does.
There are 5 available actions:

- **before**: The supplied items and sub menus will be inserted immediately
  before the target menu or item.

- **after**: The supplied items and sub menus will be inserted immediately after
  the target menu or item.

- **append**: The supplied items and sub menus will be appended at the end of
  the menu containing the target menu or item.

- **cut**: The target menu or item will be removed from the menu tree and saved
  to an internal clipboard. This can be used for deleting menus or items.
  Descendants of the @menuat setting are ignored.

- **copy**: The target menu or item will be copied and saved to
  an internal clipboard.  Descendants of the @menuat setting are ignored.

The optional **clipboard** argument modifies the action of the before, after,
and append actions. By default these actions insert the menus and items supplied
as descendants of the @menuat setting. If you specify "clipboard" (without the
quotes) as the source, the contents of the clipboard from a previous cut or copy
action will be used instead. This parameter is optional and can be left blank.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.11">The body text contains a list of settings for a font.  For example::

    body_text_font_family = Courier New
    body_text_font_size = None
    body_text_font_slant = None
    body_text_font_weight = None

**Important**: you can use the show-fonts minibuffer command to guide you in making these settings.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.12">The body text contains a list of shortcut specifiers.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.13">The body text contains a list of paths of recently opened files, one path per
line. Leo writes the list of recent files to .leoRecentFiles.txt in Leo's
config directory, again one file per line.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.14">The form of this node is::

    @mode *&lt;mode name&gt;*

The body text contains a list of shortcut specifiers. @mode nodes work just
like @shortcuts nodes, but in addition they have the side effect of creating
the enter-&lt;mode name&gt;-mode command.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.2">When reading a .leo file, Leo looks for settings in default settings
files first, then settings in personal settings files, and finally
settings in local settings files.  The exact search order is:

1. Default settings files:

   a. configDir/leoSettings.leo
   b. homeDir/leoSettings.leo
   c. localDir/leoSettings.leo

2. Personal settings files:

   a. configDir/myLeoSettings.leo
   b. homeDir/myLeoSettings.leo
   c. homeDir/&lt;machine-name&gt;LeoSettings.leo (note capitalization)
   d. localDir/myLeoSettings.leo

3. Local settings files:

   a. The file specified by the -c command-line option.
   b. The file being loaded.

Settings that appear later in this list override settings that
appear earlier in this list.  This happens on a setting-by-setting
basis, *not* on a file-by-file basis.  In other words, each individual
setting overrides only the *corresponding* setting in previously-read
files.  Reading a setting file does *not* reset all previous settings.
Note that the same file might appear several times in the search list.
Leo detects such duplicate file names and only loads each settings file once.
Leo remembers all the settings in settings files and does not reread those
settings when reading another .leo file.

**Caution**: This search order offers almost too much flexibilty. This can be
confusing, even for power users. It's important to choose the "simplest
configuration scheme that could possibly work".  Something like:

- Use a single leoSettings.leo file for installation-wide defaults.
- Use a single myLeoSettings.leo files for personal defaults.
- Use local settings sparingly.

**Important**: it is good style to limit settings placed in 
myLeoSettings.leo to those settings that differ from default settings.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.3">You should use special care when placing default or personal settings files in
**local** directories, that is, directories other than homeDir, configDir or
machineDir. In particular, the value of localDir can change when Leo reads
additional files. This can result in Leo finding new default and personal
settings files. The values of these newly-read settings files will, as always,
override any previously-read settings.

Let us say that a setting is **volatile** if it is different from a default
setting. Let us say that settings file A.leo **covers** settings file if B.leo
if all volatile settings in B.leo occur in A.leo. With these definitions, the
**safe rule** for placing settings files in local directories is::

   Settings files in local directories should
   cover all other settings files.

Following this rule will ensure that the per-directory defaults specified in the
local settings file will take precedence over all previously-read default and
personal settings files. Ignore this principle at your peril.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.5">An @buttons tree in a settings file defines global buttons that
are created in the icon area of all .leo files.
All @button nodes in the @commands tree create global buttons.
All @button nodes outside the commands tree create buttons local to the settings file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.6">An @commands tree in a settings file defines global commands.
All @command nodes in the @commands tree create global commands.
All @command nodes outside the commands tree create commands local to the settings file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.7">The body text contains a list of strings, one per line.
Lines starting with '#' are ignored.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.8">The body text of the @enabled plugins node contains a list of enabled plugins,
one per line. Comment lines starting with '#' are ignored. Leo loads plugins in
the order they appear.
**Important**: Leo handles @enabled-plugins nodes a differently from other kinds
of settings. To avoid confusion, **please read the following carefully**.

As always, Leo looks for @enabled-plugins nodes in settings files in the order
specified by `Search order for settings files`_. Leo will enable all plugins
found in the @enabled-plugins node it finds *last* in the search order. Leo does
*not* enable plugins found in any other @enabled-plugins node. In particular,
**you can not specify a list of default plugins by placing that list in a
settings file that appears early in the search list**. Instead, the last
@enabled-plugins node found in the search list specifies all and *only* the plugins
that will be enabled.

Let us distinguish two different situations. First, what Leo does when loading a
file, say x.leo. Second, what Leo does when loading a second file, say y.leo,
*from x.leo*. When loading the first .leo file, Leo enables plugins from the
@enabled-plugins node it finds *last* in the search order. But after plugins
have *already* been loaded and enabled, there is no way to disable previously
loaded-and-enabled plugins. But local settings files can enable additional
plugins.

To avoid confusion, I highly recommend following another kind of safe rule.
We say that an @enabled-plugin node in file A.leo **covers** an @enabled-plugin
node in file B.leo if all plugins specified in B's @enabled-plugin node appear
A's @enabled-plugin node. The safe rule for plugins is::

  @enabled-plugin nodes in settings files in local directories
  should cover @enabled-plugins nodes in all other settings files.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116094356.9">Leo creates its menus from the @menu, @item and @popup nodes in the @menus tree.
Within @menus trees, @menu nodes create menus and @item nodes create menu items. 

The menu name always follows @menu. If the menu name is 'Plugins', Leo will
create the Plugins menu and populate the menu by calling the
'create-optional-menus' hook. This creates the Plugins menu as usual. Nested
@menu nodes define submenus.

The command name follows @item. If the body text of an @item node exists, this
body text is the menu name. Otherwise, the menu name is the command name.
However, if the command name starts with a '*', hyphens are removed from the
menu name. Menu names and command names may contain a single ampersand (&amp;). If
present, the following character is underlined in the name. If the command
name in an @item node is just a hyphen (-), the item represents a menu
separator.

@popup *&lt;widget-name&gt;* creates a popup menu for use by the rClick plugin.
The children of this node should be @menu and @item nodes, used as with
@menus.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090116130002.1">Settings files can be found in the following directories:

- **homeDir**, the HOME/.leo directory. HOME is given by Python's HOME
  environment variable, or by os.expanduser('~') if no HOME environment variable
  exists.

- **configDir**, Leo's configuration directory: leo/config.

- **machineDir**, the HOME/.leo/MACHINE directory. MACHINE is given by Python's
  HOSTNAME environment variable, or by Python's COMPUTERNAME environment
  variable if there is no HOSTNAME variable, or by the value returned by
  socket.gethostname() if neither environment variable exists.

- **localDir**, the directory containing the .leo file being loaded.

In addition, Leo's -c command-line option can specify any .leo file anywhere.</t>

    w.setBackgroundColor(color)         # Set the background color.
    w.setSelectionRange(i,j,insert=None) # Select the text.
    w.setForegroundColor(color)         # Set the foreground color.

**Notes**:

- These are only the most commonly-used methods.
  For more information, consult Leo's source code.

- i and j are zero-based indices into the the text.
  When j is not specified, it defaults to i.
  When the sort parameter is in effect, getSelectionRange
  ensures i &lt;= j.

- color is a tk color name, even when using the qt gui plugin.

<t tx="ekr.20090307063422.4">Reads a file into a single node.
@edit is similar to @auto; saving a .leo file does not save dirty @edit nodes
if they do not contain a **significant** amount of information. An @edit tree
contains a significant amount of information if it has children or if the root
node contains more than 10 characters.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090307063422.7">Initially, Leo's File:Open command creates such nodes when opening any
non-.leo file.

When writing @edit nodes, Leo uses Leo's @auto write logic.  That is,
no sentinels are written.

When reading @edit nodes, Leo just puts then entire text of the file
into the node, along with @language or @nocolor directives as
appropriate.  These added directives will not change the file when it
gets written because no sentinels are written.</t>

Leo 4.6 b1 is now available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.6:
--------------------------

- Leo now requires Python 2.4 or later.
- Leo now features a modern Qt interface;
  Leo's legacy Tk interface can also be used.
- New --config --file and --gui command-line options.
- Dozens of small improvements and bug fixes.

Personally, I'd like to see another config file available via -c on
the command line:
(a common idiom)

leo myproject.leo -c /usr/lib/myproject/myLeoSettings.leo

or better yet:

leo myproject.leo -c /etc/leo/style01.leo
leo myotherproject.leo -c /etc/leo/style02.leo
leo anotherproject.leo -c /etc/leo/style23.leo

Each file opens in an editor with the shortcuts, buttons, commands,
plugins, appearance etc.  that has been tuned for that data management task.

or best yet:

leo myproject.leo -c /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/leo/config/style94.leo

Please, I think each file has a distinct and required role.

- config/leoSettings.leo = Edward's base, required for a sane starting point

- home/.leo/myLeoSettings.leo = adjust Edwards suggestions to taste

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090324145450.23">- Leo opens a default .leo file if no other is specified, using the @string
  default_leo_file setting. The default for this setting is
  ~/.leo/workbook.leo

- Added escapes for underindented lines. The escape is specified by the @string
  underindent-escape-string setting. By default, this escape is \- If a line
  starts with \-N, Leo will write the line with N fewer spaces than expected.

- Leo now warns when attempting to write a file that has been changed outside of
  Leo. This prevents bzr reversions.

- Leo tests syntax of .py files when saving them.

- Leo can now open any file into an @edit node. This allows Leo to be associated
  with the edit action of .py files. Like this::

    C:\Python26\python.exe "c:\leo.repo\trunk\launchLeo.py" --gui=qt %1 %2

- Leo now warns if when writing an @auto node if the the file exists and the
  node has not been read previously.  This prevents a newly-created
  @auto node from overwriting an existing file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090324145450.27">- Added autoCompleter.getExternalCompletions.
  See http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/4ad91984a6d0acac

- Added g.posList.

- c.config.doEnabledPlugins sets g.app.config.enabledPluginsFileName

- Added the following properties:
    - p.b, t.b and v.b return the body string of the position or node.
    - p.h, t.h and v.h return the head string of the position or node.
    - t.u and v.u return the uA of the node.
    - p.gnx, t.gnx and v.gnx return the gnx of the position or node.

- Added script to leoSettings.leo to ensure all menu items are valid.

- c.config.getSettingSource(setting_name)
  returns the name of the file which Leo used to determine the setting:

    - D indicates default settings.
    - F indicates the file being loaded
    - L indicates leoSettings.leo
    - M indicates myLeoSettings.leo

- Predefined 'self' in @test/@suite nodes.

- Added c.getNodePath and c.getNodeFileName.
  See http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/3b5f1232ecc6bba7
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090324145450.36">- The --config command-line option specifies a single config (.leo) file
  to use for configuration.
  See http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/f3f95d93bcd93b94

- The --file=fileName command-line option load a file.
  Only .zip and .leo extensions are allowed at present.

- The --gui=name command-line option specifies the gui to use.
  The valid values are --gui=qt, --gui=tk
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090324145450.40">- Added smart home (back-to-home) command.

- Added support for standard behavior of Tab and Shift-Tab keys.
  The tab key indents the text selection, if there is one;
  otherwise, the tab key insert a tab or blanks, depending on the @tabwidth setting.
  Shift-Tab always unindents one or more lines.

- The open command creates @edit nodes when opening non-.leo files
  The open file dialog now shows all files by default.
  Selecting a non-.leo file will load that file into a new node in the present outline.

- Added added pdb minibuffer command.
  This works, but stops Leo in the middle of the command-handling logic.
  You may get the commander c by stepping out into
  k.masterKeyHandler or k.masterCommandHandler.
  Using c, you can then get all other info.

- Improved the isearch commands.

- find-clone-all is a synonym for clone-find-all.

- open-quickstart-leo command opens leo/doc/quickstart.leo.

- The Alt-Right and Alt-Left keys (expand-and-go-right and contract-or-go-left
  commands) now move to the previous or next node if now left/right movement is
  possible.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090324145450.46">- Added @nocolor-node directive.

- Improved \@path handling.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090324145450.49">- @string default_leo_file = ~/.leo/workbook.leo

- @string underindent-escape-string = \-

- @int icon_bar_widgets_per_row

- Added support for meta keys.
  http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/b6a39ed672a28c65?pli=1

- The qt gui is now the default.

- The old bindings bound the PageUp/Down keys to back/forward page commands, and
  these commands work only for text.

  The new default bindings in leoSettings.leo: @keys EKR bindings are::

    back-page                       ! text = PageUp
    back-page-extend-selection      ! text = Shift-PageUp
    forward-page                    ! text = PageDn
    forward-page-extend-selection   ! text = Shift-PageDn

    scroll-down-half-page   ! tree = Shift-PageDn
    scroll-down-page        ! tree = PageDn
    scroll-up-half-page     ! tree = Shift-PageUp
    scroll-up-page          ! tree = PageUp    

- @bool enable_alt_ctrl_bindings.
  The default is False, needed for AltGr functionality on Windows.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090324145450.54">- Improved nav_buttons plugin and corresponding nodeHistory class.

- Created qtGui and tkGui plugins.

- Created leoGuiPluginsRef.leo.

- Leo issues an error message if a non-existent plugin appears
  in an @enabled-plugin node.
  
- New plugins: spydershell.py, qtframecommands.py, and mod_framesize.py.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090401113141.1">To generate .odt or .rtf or .pdf files, you create an intermediate file and
ignore the the "official" output file, in this case test.html. The intermediate
file contains the rST text corresponding to the @rst tree.

To tell the rst3 plugin to generate an intermediate file, do::

    write_intermediate_file = True

After you create the intermediate file, in this case, test.html.txt,
You can create an odt file as follows::

    python &lt;path-to-python&gt;/scripts/rst2odt.py test.html.txt test.odt

I a batch file, rst2odt.bat, like this:

    rst2odt test

Note that rst3odt.py is in the tools directory of the DocUtils distribution.

To generate .rtf, you can use PanDoc to convert test.html.txt to RTF.

To generate .pdf files, you would first convert test.html.txt to LaTeX::

    python rst2newlatex.py test.html.txt test.tex

    -- OR --

    cd leo\docs\html
    make latex

You can then use one of the LaTeX to .pdf converters to create the final .pdf
file. See http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/latex.html#pdf-generation
for details.

<t tx="ekr.20090526102407.10030">I've often said that I don't remember many details about Leo. This documentation
describes what I *do* remember about Leo's various modules. I hope this will be
useful to potential readers, users and modifiers of Leo's code.

In general, if you want to understand the code, read through it quickly, looking
for pieces of code that are unexpected complex, or unexpectedly simple. Forget
the details; remember the shape. Once you have the general shape in mind, you
are ready to modify the code. No kidding. Besides, more reading won't help :-)</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090526102407.10031">In general, write code is much simpler than read code,
because reading requires parsing. There are a few exceptions below.

leoFileCommands.py contains the code that reads and writes .leo files.

- This file uses the sax parser to parse the xml in .leo files.
- Complex code, driven by sax, turns sax nodes into Leo nodes.
- The putVnode method is "interesting".  Take a look.
  In the past, there have been significant, surprising bottlenecks in
  putVnode and maybe putTnode as well.  No longer.

leoAtFileCommands.py contains the code that reads and writes external files.

- There are options to read and write strings.
  These are useful for performance and for unit testing.
- atFile.replaceTargetFileIfDifferent is an important optimization.
- There are a lot of read/write commands for external files,
  and this results in lots of options being passed around.

Initing is tricky for both leoFileCommands.py and leoAtFileCommands.py.

- The bizarre call to initReadIvars() at the end of getLeoFile is one
  symptom of the difficulties.
- Never change init code without careful thought and unit testing.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090526102407.10032">I. Background

Leo has had a robust MVC (Model,View,Controller) architecture from day one.

Leo's model are the classes in leoNodes.py. They are completely independent from
the rest of Leo. Many parts of Leo *use* these classes, but not vice versa!

Leo's controller is everything else in 'Code--&gt;Core classes'. This code has *no*
direct dependencies on Leo's gui code, as will be explained next.

Leo's view has two parts:

1. The classes in the tree 'Code--&gt;Gui Base classes'.
   These are part of Leo's core.

2. The classes in the tree 'Code--&gt;Gui Tkinter classes'.
   These are essentailly a gui plugin.

Leo's core consists of the Model, Controller and the gui base classes.


II. Why Leo's core is gui-independent

Leo uses a completely standard way of separating gui-dependent code from
gui-independent code. Base gui classes (part 1 of the view) define an interface
used by Leo's core. Subclasses (part 2 of the view) implement the interface for
a particular gui.

** Subclasses can change without affecting Leo's code in any way.**

The essential design rule is: if gui-related code can be made gui- independent,
it should be part of a base class. Otherwise it must be part of a subclass of a
base gui class.

The gui base classes are far more than do-nothing interfaces. Examples of
complex code that reside in base classes:

A. tree.select. I am proud that this method is gui-independent. Switching nodes
is a very tricky business. Making it gui-independent is a big win.

B. leoFind.py. Finds the next/previous matches, and dealing with an "idealized"
find tab. Adapter classes exist in leoEditCommands.py.

C. Autocompletion and minibuffer code in leoKeys.py. For comparison, look how
simple leoTkinterKeys.py is.

D. A generalized, gui-independent interface to Leo's body pane. The commands in
leoEditCommands.py (part of the controller) use this interface (baseTextWidget)
rather than calling Tk directly.

**If you want to understand Leo's design, study Leo's base gui classes.**

Leo 4.6 b2 is now available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.6:
--------------------------

- Cached external files *greatly* reduces the time to load .leo files.
- Leo now features a modern Qt interface by default.
  Leo's legacy Tk interface can also be used.
- New --config, --file and --gui command-line options.
- Leo tests syntax of .py files when saving them.
- Leo can now open any kind of file into @edit nodes.
- @auto-rst nodes support "round-tripping" of reStructuredText files.
- Properties of commanders, positions and nodes simplify programming.
- Improved Leo's unit testing framework.
- Leo now requires Python 2.5 or later.
- Dozens of small improvements and bug fixes.

The expected/customary behaviour (one you get used to in almost every editor) is:

End: always move to end of line
Home: Move to first visible chararacter on the line. When pressing home again, move to column zero. If Home is pressed one more time, move to first visible character again.

This is also the way emacs behaves, though ctrl+a always moves to column zero.</t>

I have 'dabbrev-expands' bound to the F4 key. When I press F4 after

Leo 4.5.1 shows a hour-glass for a while before giving an empty
dabbrev-expand: prompt in the minibuffer.

If I back up one character, putting point between the e and q and then
type F4, I get the expected behavior: the word "frequency" is inserted
immediately.

- Removed "not ready messages".
- Made the code undoable.
- Added wimpy unit test.</t>

With a long body text you might place the cursor on a line, hold down Shift, and
PgDn several pages to select a large block of text. The last PgDn may overshoot
the range you want selected, so you should be able to use UpArrow to bring the
bottom of the range back up to where you want it. However, on the first UpArrow
the selection is lost and restarted from the current cursor position. I.e. you
end up with just one line selected, instead of trimming one line of the
selection of several pages, as intended.

<t tx="ekr.20090622091845.5623">Installing Leo on MacOS 10.5 (Leopard) is straightforward.

1. MacOS 10.5 comes with Python pre-installed.
   See http://www.python.org/download/mac/ and
   http://wiki.python.org/moin/MacPython/Leopard
   for information about using the latest version of Python.

2. Download and install bzr:

   - Download bzr from http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download

   - Install bzr using the file just downloaded.

3. Get Leo's sources from Leo's trunk::

    cd ~
    mkdir leo.repo
    cd leo.repo
    bzr init
    bzr branch lp:leo-editor
    cd leo-editor

4. You can run the tk version of Leo as follows::

    python launchLeo.py --gui=tk

5. If you already have Qt and PyQt installed, you can run the qt version of Leo as follows::

    python launchLeo.py --gui=qt

6. If you don't have Qt or PyQt installed, you will have to install Qt and PyQt
    from sources. There does not seem to be any pre-built binaries.

    A: You may need to install XCode from http://developer.apple.com/mac/
       in order to get a development environment.

    B: Download and install the sip package, following the direction at
       http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download

    C: Download the OpenSource Qt libraries for Mac from
       http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads

    D: At various points along the way you will need to build the sources::

         python configure.py 
         make
         sudo make install
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090705111443.10370">Leo sends more detailed error messages to stderr,
the output stream that goes to the console window. In Linux and MacOS
environments, python programs normally execute with the console window visible.
On Windows, can run Leo with the console window visible by associating .leo
files with python.exe *not* pythonw.exe. 

.. For full instructions about how
.. to do this, see `Associating Leo with .leo Files`_.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20090706042206.14718">Leo's sentinels add outline structure to source files.
However, those sentinels annoy some people who don't use Leo.

You can use @auto, @shadow or @nosent trees to edit
files that are shared with those who don't want to see sentinel comments.

- @auto is best for files whose imported outline structure often changes. In
  most cases, this will be the best option. The drawback of @auto files are a)
  you can't use clones and b) you can't add your own organizer nodes.

- @shadow will work for files whose outline structure seldom changes.
  The advantage of @shadow is that you can add your own structure.

- @nosent is appropriate only for files that you alone modify.

- We must ensure that the file will be written if the user does significant work.
- We must ensure that the user can create an @auto x node at any time
  without risk of of replacing x with empty or insignificant information.
- We want the user to be able to create an @auto node which will be populated the next time the .leo file is opened.
- We don't want minor import imperfections to be written to the @auto file.

Leo 4.6 final is now available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.6:
--------------------------

- Cached external files *greatly* reduces the time to load .leo files.
- Leo now features a modern Qt interface by default.
  Leo's legacy Tk interface can also be used.
- New --config, --file and --gui command-line options.
- Leo tests syntax of .py files when saving them.
- Leo can now open any kind of file into @edit nodes.
- @auto-rst nodes allow easy editing of reStructuredText files.
- Properties of commanders, positions and nodes simplify programming.
- Improved Leo's unit testing framework.
- Leo now requires Python 2.5 or later.
- Dozens of small improvements and bug fixes.

The expected/customary behaviour (one you get used to in almost every editor) is:

End: always move to end of line
Home: Move to first visible chararacter on the line. When pressing home again, move to column zero. If Home is pressed one more time, move to first visible character again.

This is also the way emacs behaves, though ctrl+a always moves to column zero.</t>

the word "freq" in a body pane containing the word "frequency" then
Leo 4.5.1 shows a hour-glass for a while before giving an empty

If I back up one character, putting point between the e and q and then
type F4, I get the expected behavior: the word "frequency" is inserted

With a long body text you might place the cursor on a line, hold down Shift, and
PgDn several pages to select a large block of text. The last PgDn may overshoot
the range you want selected, so you should be able to use UpArrow to bring the
bottom of the range back up to where you want it. However, on the first UpArrow
the selection is lost and restarted from the current cursor position. I.e. you
end up with just one line selected, instead of trimming one line of the
selection of several pages, as intended.

leo myproject.leo -c /usr/lib/myproject/myLeoSettings.leo

or better yet:

leo myproject.leo -c /etc/leo/style01.leo
leo myotherproject.leo -c /etc/leo/style02.leo
leo anotherproject.leo -c /etc/leo/style23.leo

Each file opens in an editor with the shortcuts, buttons, commands,
plugins, appearance etc.  that has been tuned for that data management task.

or best yet:

leo myproject.leo -c /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/leo/config/style94.leo

- home/.leo/myLeoSettings.leo = adjust Edwards suggestions to taste

Leo 4.6.1 final is now available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

Leo 4.6.1 fixes several minor bugs in Leo 4.6.


The highlights of Leo 4.6
--------------------------

- Cached external files *greatly* reduces the time to load .leo files.
- Leo now features a modern Qt interface by default.
  Leo's legacy Tk interface can also be used.
- New --config, --file and --gui command-line options.
- Leo tests syntax of .py files when saving them.
- Leo can now open any kind of file into @edit nodes.
- @auto-rst nodes allow easy editing of reStructuredText files.
- Properties of commanders, positions and nodes simplify programming.
- Improved Leo's unit testing framework.
- Leo now requires Python 2.5 or later.
- Dozens of small improvements and bug fixes.

End: always move to end of line
Home: Move to first visible chararacter on the line. When pressing home again, move to column zero. If Home is pressed one more time, move to first visible character again.

With a long body text you might place the cursor on a line, hold down Shift, and
PgDn several pages to select a large block of text. The last PgDn may overshoot
the range you want selected, so you should be able to use UpArrow to bring the
bottom of the range back up to where you want it. However, on the first UpArrow
the selection is lost and restarted from the current cursor position. I.e. you
end up with just one line selected, instead of trimming one line of the
selection of several pages, as intended.

leo myotherproject.leo -c /etc/leo/style02.leo
leo anotherproject.leo -c /etc/leo/style23.leo

Each file opens in an editor with the shortcuts, buttons, commands,

Leo 4.7 beta 1 is now available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

This version of Leo is labeled a beta version because it contains some new,
relatively untested plugins.  However, Leo's core should be quite reliable.

In particular, Leo 4.7 beta 1 fixes a bug that caused Leo 4.6 releases to crash
if .leoID.txt did not exist. Usually this file does exist, but Leo will prompt
for the contents of this file (a user id) the very first time somebody uses Leo.
Alas, an unfortunate reversion of code caused Leo to crash. Not exactly the best
introduction to Leo!

The highlights of Leo 4.7:
--------------------------

- A major simplification of internal data model: the so-called
  one-node world. Note: this is **disabled** in the beta 1 release.
- A new executable Windows installer, whose manifest is created from
  the files that bzr actively manages.
- Leo no longer adds directories to sys.path on startup.
- New plugins.
- The usual assortment of bug fixes.

**Important**: With the exception of the p.v ivar, scripts should be careful to
use only the methods of the position and vnode classes rather than the internal
ivars of these classes. Doing so will ensure that the script is as simple as
possible and that the script will continue to work regardless of future changes
to the internals of these classes.

 **Important**:
    Positions can become *invalid* when the structure of the outline changes.
    As discussed below, plugins and scripts that store positions for use at a later time should make sure the

<t tx="ekr.20091107093823.6792"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20091107093823.6793">Leo organizes all data into nodes containing a **headline**, an expandable page of
**body text** and a (possibly empty) subtree of **descendant nodes**. The **contents** of a
node are its headline and body text. Leo’s main window contains an **outline** pane
at the top left, a **log pane** at the top right, and a **body pane** at the bottom. The
outline pane shows headlines; the body pane shows the body text of the selected
headline. The log pane displays messages from Leo.

Small red arrows mark **cloned nodes** (clones). Clones share the same content and
descendants. All clones of the same node are equivalent, so changing the
contents of one node (call it node N) changes the contents of all clones of N.
Furthermore, inserting, deleting or changing any descendant of node N causes the
corresponding insertion, deletion or change in all other clones of N.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091107093823.6794">Clones allow you to organize data in multiple ways within the same outline. You
do not have to choose a single ‘correct’ organization: you can organize your
data in as many ways as you like.

You can use **organizer nodes** to create explicit relations (relationships) among
the data in your outline. The headline of the organizer node is the
relationship’s name. Now make clones of nodes from other parts of the outline
that participate in the relation. Drag the newly created clones so they become
children of the organizer node. You may want to create other (non-cloned)
children of the organizer node that contain data found nowhere else in the
outline. Voilà: you have just created the set of all nodes that pertain to the
relationship. The organizer node is the relation; the terms relation,
relationship and organizer node are interchangeable.

Three kinds of relations deserve special mention. A **view** is a relation (an
organizer node) containing all nodes related to a desired view (or slice) of the
data in the outline. Similarly, a **task** is an organizer node containing all nodes
related to a task. Relations are not limited to tasks or views: the notion of
relationship is completely general. Headlines naturally describe the data in
body text. That is, nodes relate **metadata** (descriptions of data) to data.
Separating data from metadata is useful for humans. It is even more valuable for
scripts: scripts can access data and metadata without complex parsing.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091107093823.6795">Plugins are Python (.py) files contained in Leo’s plugins folder. Users can
write plugins to change how Leo works and to add new features without changing
Leo’s core code. We’ll discuss plugins in more detail later.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091107093823.6796">Leo can generate many external files called **derived files** from an outline. Leo
outlines can organize files throughout your computer’s file system. Nodes whose
headlines start with ‘@’ are special nodes. Several **special nodes** indicate the
root of a tree that generates a derived file::

    @asis filename    Creates a derived file. Ignores all markup in body text.
    @file filename    Creates a derived file. Duplicates outline structure in .leo file.
    @noref filename   Creates a derived file. Ignores all section references.
    @nosent filename  Creates a derived file without sentinels.
    @thin filename    (Recommended) Like @file, but thin derived files contain all outline structure.

Leo recognizes several other special nodes::

    @settings   Defines settings local to the .leo file.
    @url url    Double-clicking the node’s icon opens the url in Leo or in a browser.

The scripting plugin scans for the following nodes when opening an outline::

    @button         Creates a button in the **icon area** at the top of the Leo window.
    @plugin plugin  Enables a plugin if the plugin has not already been enabled.
    @script         Executes a script when opening the outline. This is a security risk: it is disabled by default.

Plugins, @button nodes and @script nodes can create other kinds of special nodes::

    @suite       Creates a suite of unit tests from script in body. Requires scripting plugin.
    @test        Creates a unit text from script in body. Requires scripting plugin.
    @rst         Outputs a tree containing markup for reStructuredText. Requires rst2 plugin.
    @run command Double clicking the node’s icon executes the command.  Requires run_nodes plugin.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091107093823.6797">Leo’s Execute Script command **preprocesses** the script to be executed by scanning
a node N and its descendents looking for markup. **Markup** is special syntax that
controls this preprocessing. If node N contains no markup, the resulting script
is just N’s body text. Otherwise, the preprocessed script will include text from
descendent nodes as described below. The main kinds of markup are **section
references**, **directives** and **doc parts**.

1.  **Section references** have the form::

        &lt;&lt;section name&gt;&gt;

    The &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; must appear on the same line. Conversely, any line
    containing &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; is a section reference, regardless of context. However,
    section references are not recognized in doc parts. Any characters may appear
    between &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;.
    
    Section references are functional pseudo-code: while preprocessing a script, Leo
    replaces section references by the actual text of the section’s definition.
    Sections are defined in **section definition nodes**, whose headlines start with a
    section reference and whose body text defines the section. Each section
    definition node must descend from the node containing the section reference.

2.  **Directives** start with ‘@’ in the leftmost column of body text. Directives
    specify options and control Leo’s operation. The @others directive is the
    minimal markup needed to organize scripts. @others tells Leo to insert the
    preprocessed text of all descendant nodes (except section definition nodes) at
    the spot at which the @others directive occurs. Nodes are inserted in **outline
    order**, the order in which nodes appear in the outline. **Important**: Leo adds the
    whitespace preceding the @others directive to the indentation of all
    preprocessed text.
    
    Using @others is more convenient than using section references. Use @others when
    the order of included text does not matter::
    
        class myClass:
	        @others # Include the methods of the class. Order doesn’t matter.

    Use section references when the order of included text does matter. In the following script, for example,
    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt; ensures that imports come first. The @others directive then includes the body text of all other
    descendant nodes::
    
        @language python
        &lt;&lt; imports&gt;&gt;
        @others # Define classes &amp; functions in child nodes.
        main()

    Here is a list of all of Leo’s standard directives::
    
        @whitespace (or @doc)   Starts a doc part &amp; ends code part.
        @all                    Like @others, but includes all descendent nodes.
        @c, @code               Starts a code part and ends a doc part.
        @color                  Enables syntax coloring.
        @delims                 Temporarily changes comment delims.
        @nocolor, @killcolor    Disables syntax coloring.
        @comment                Sets comment delimiters in external (derived) files.
        @language languagename  Sets language for syntax coloring and comments.
        @lineending lineending  Sets ending of lines in derived files.
        @others                 Inserts body text of all descendents except definition nodes. 
        @pagewidth n            Sets page width for justifying comments in doc parts.
        @path path              Sets prefix to use in relative file names in @file nodes, etc.
        @root filename          Marks the root of a tree that creates an external file.
        @raw, @end_raw          Inhibits sections references in a range of text. (@file only.)
        @tabwidth n             Sets width of tabs (negative widths convert tabs to spaces.)
        @wrap, @nowrap          Controls wrapping of text in body pane.
    
3.  Doc parts start with the ‘@’ directive and continue until the end of the body text or until the ‘@c’ directive.
    Body text not in a doc part is in a code part. Here is an example of a doc part::

        @ This is a doc part. Doc parts may span many lines. Leo converts doc parts to comments.
        Leo reformats the doc part by justifying lines so they are no longer than the page width.
        @c

    Leo reformats doc parts by justifying the text into comment lines.
    The @pagewidth directive controls the length of these comment lines.
    The @language and @comment directives specify the comment delimiters used in doc parts.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091107093823.6798">The Execute Script command preprocesses the selected text of the presently
selected outline node, or the entire text of the node if there is no selected
text. See the section called Markup for Scripts for a discussion of how Leo
preprocesses scripts. That section also discusses how Leo organizes scripts
using outlines. Conversely, scripts can use outlines to organize their data. To
write such scripts you must understand at least the basics of Leo’s modules and
classes...
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091107093823.6799">Leo’s source code is organized as a collection of modules. The following
paragraphs describe five of the most important modules. See LeoPy.leo (Leo’s
full source code) for more details: scripts have full access to all of Leo’s
classes and data.

1.  The **leoGlobals** module contains utility functions.
    By convention, in Leo’s code g is always the leoGlobals module.

2.  The **leoApp** module defines a class representing the entire Leo application.
    **g.app** is the singleton object of this class: the application object.
    The instance variables (ivars) of the application object are Leo’s global variables.
 
3.  The leoCommands module defines the Commands class.
    A commander is an instance of this class.
    Commanders contain the operations that can be performed on a particular outline.
    Each open Leo outline has its own commander.
    By convention, in Leo’s code **c** is always a commander.

4.  The leoFrame module defines the base leoFrame class for objects that create and manage
    the visual appearance of Leo’s windows and panes.
    The **leoTkinterFrame** and **leoTkinterTree** modules contain subclasses of the base classes in the leoFrame module.
    A frame (an instance of the leoFrame class, or a subclass)
    contains all the internal data needed to manage a Leo window.
    **c.frame** is the frame associated with commander c.
    If **f** is a frame, **f.c** is the frame’s commander, **f.body** is the frame’s body pane,
    **f.tree** is the frame’s outline pane, and **f.log** is the frame’s log pane.

5.  The leoNodes module defines several classes that implement Leo’s fundamental data structures.
    These classes are complex.
    Happily, scripts can and should ignore these complications by accessing nodes using
    high-level methods of the position class.

A **position** (an instance of the position class) is the state of some traversal of an outline. Equivalently, a position is a particular visual place in an outline. Cloned nodes may appear many times in an outline. Non-cloned nodes may also appear in many places: consider a non-cloned descendant of a cloned node. By convention, in Leo’s source code p is a position.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091107093823.6800">When executing scripts Leo predefines the following three symbols:
**c** is the commander of the outline in which the script is defined,
**g** is the leoGlobals module and
**p** is the position of the selected node in c’s outline, i.e., c.currentPosition().
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091107093823.6801">Scripts should get and set data using high-level access methods. Here are some important getters::

    g.app                The application object. Its ivars are Leo’s global variables.
    g.app.windowList     The list of all open frames.
    c.currentPosition()  The position of the selected node.
    c.rootPosition()     The position of the first node in the outline.
    p.headString()       The headline of position p.
    p.bodyString()       The body text of position p.
    p.childIndex()       The number of siblings that precede p.
    p.numberOfChildren() The number of p’s children.
    p.level()            The number of p’s ancestors.
    p.hasChildren()      True if p has children.
    p.isAncestorOf(p2)   True if p2 is a child, grandchild, etc. of p.
    p.isCloned()         True if p is a clone.
    p.isDirty()          True if p’s contents have been changed.
    p.isExpanded()       True if p has children and p’s outline is expanded.
    p.isMarked()         True if p’s headline is marked.
    p.isVisible()        True if all of p’s ancestors are expanded.

And here are some important setters::

    p.setBodyStringOrPane(s) Set body text of p to s.
    p.setHeadString(s)       Set headline of p to s.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091107093823.6802">Scripts can visit some or all of the nodes of a Leo outline using the following iterators::

    c.allNodes_iter             # All positions in the outline, in outline order.
    p.children_iter()           # All children of p.
    p.parents_iter()            # All parents of p.
    p.siblings_iter()           # All siblings of p, including p.
    p.following_siblings_iter() # All siblings following p, not including p.

For example, the following prints all the nodes of an outline, properly indented::

    for p in c.allNodes_iter():
        print ' '*p.level(), p.headString()</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091107093823.6803">Scripts may open other Leo outlines, or execute any of Leo’s commands.  Here are some examples::

    ok,frame = g.openWithFileName(path,c)	# Opens the .leo file found at path.
    c.deleteOutline()   # Deletes the selected node.
    c.insertHeadline()  # Inserts a new node after present position.

For more examples, see Chapter 7: Scripting Leo with Python, in Leo’s Users Guide.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091107093823.6804">The scripting plugin creates two buttons in the icon area at the top of the Leo
window. The Run Script button executes the script in the selected node just
like the Execute Script command. The Script Button button creates a new
button whose headline is the headline of the presently selected node, call it
node N. Pressing this button executes the script in node N with p predefined as
c.currentPosition() at the time the script is executed. This clever trick
brings the script to the data in the selected outline.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091107093823.6805">test.leo contains all of Leo’s unit tests. An @button node in test.leo
creates a blue Unit Test button in the icon area. This button is an
excellent example of bringing scripts to data. The Unit Test button executes
all the unit tests specified by @test and @suite nodes in the selected
outline. **Important**: @button, @test and @suite nodes require the
scripting plugin to be enabled.

@test nodes greatly simplify unit testing. The Unit Test button creates
a unit test from the body text of each @test node. In effect, the Unit
Test button automatically creates an instance of unittest.TestCase whose
run method is the body text of the @test node. There is no need to create
TestCase objects explicitly!

@suite nodes support legacy unit tests. When the Unit Test script button
finds an @suite node it executes the script in its body text. This script
should create a suite of unit tests and set::

    g.app.scriptDict['suite'] = suite

where suite is the created suite. The Unit Test button then runs that
created suite of unit tests.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091107093823.6806">Plugins are Python (.py) files in Leo’s plugin subdirectory. It is easy to
create new plugins: Leo’s users have contributed dozens of plugins that extend
Leo’s capabilities in new ways. Leo imports all enabled plugins during startup.
The file pluginsManager.txt lists all enabled plugins. You can use the plugin
manager plugin to control plugins without updating pluginsManager.txt by hand.

Plugins can override any class, method or function in Leo’s core, the files in
Leo’s src subdirectory (the files derived from LeoPy.leo). Besides altering
Leo’s core, plugins can register functions called hooks that Leo calls at
various times during Leo’s execution. Events that trigger hooks include key
pressed events, screen drawing events, node selection events and many others.
When importing a plugin, Leo will call the top-level init() function if it
exists. This function should register the plugin’s hooks by calling
leoPlugins.registerHandler.

For full details about hooks and events see Chapter 8: Customizing Leo, in
Leo’s Users Guide. The file leoPlugins.leo contains all plugins that are
presently distributed with Leo; studying these plugins is a good way of learning
to write your own plugins.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20091107181442.26607">Leo's **vnode** classe represents all the data in a particular node.
In the simplied data model, a single vnode represents all clones on the screen.
When Leo clones a vnode v, alters data structures in v and v's parent vnode,
but Leo does *not* create another vnode to represent the clone.
Thus, the *exact same* vnode may appear in several places on Leo's outline pane.

Leo's **position** class represents a position (spot) in Leo's outline pane.
More exactly, a position represents the state of a tree traversal of Leo's data.
Vnode's may appear several times in a traversal, which is another way of saying
that vnodes may appear several times in Leo's outline pane.

Leo's **generators** generate lists of positions.
For example, c.all_positions() generates a list of all positions in the outline.
As another example, given a position p,
p.self_and_subtree() generates a list of all descendants of the vnode at position p.

Leo' **position methods** provide other ways ways of finding positions.
Given a position p, p.parent() is the p's parent position,
p.firstChild() is the position of p's first child (if it exists),
and p.next() is the position of p's next sibling (again, if it exists).
Many other position methods exist, as discussed below.

Leo's execute-script command predefines several symbols.  This makes it easy to
access the data in Leo outlines and the Leo's own source code. g is predefined
to the leoGlobals module. Scripts commonly use utility functions such as g.es,
g.trace, etc. The g.app object represents Leo itself. The instance vars (ivars)
of g.app are Leo's global variables and constants. The execute-script command
predefines c to be the commander (see below) of the Leo outline in which the
script is contained. Whenever possible, scripts should use the high-level
methods of the commander to insert, delete or clone nodes. Finally, the
execute-script commands predefines p to be the presently selected position.

Chapter 2: The Leo Tutorial
############################

Leo is a power tool for people who want to organize, study and work with data,
especially complex data like computer programs, books, web sites and data bases.
Superficially, Leo may look like other outlining programs, code folding editors
or class browsers, but it most certainly is not.

People say Leo is a revolutionary tool, and that Leo is fun to use, even
additive. There is a unique "Leo way" of managing data; the term **Leonine**
describes how people treat data in "the world according to Leo". Leo definitely
takes a bit of work to understand. Leo's users speak of an "Aha" moment, when
they see how these pieces fit together: outline structure is significant
everywhere.

Leo is freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms. You
may download Leo from http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/Leo/ Leo is Open
Software and may be freely distributed.

`Leo's home page`_ contains additional documentation and links to other
resources. For another introduction to Leo, open the file quickstart.leo in the
leo/doc folder.

This tutorial introduces the reader to the basic concepts and features of Leo.
It helps to have Leo running for hands-on experience, but all examples here are
self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.
See `Leo's Installation Guide`_. for detailed installation instructions. If you
have problems installing Leo, please ask for help on `Leo's help forum`_. 

This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single
feature of Leo, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many
of Leo's most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of Leo's flavor
and style. After reading it, you will be able to use Leo in basic ways to create
external files, organize data and run simple scripts. You will then be ready to
learn more about Leo's many advanced features in `Leo's Users Guide`_.

.. The :ref:`glossary` is also worth going through.

<t tx="ekr.20091130111843.6814">Let's start looking at Leo in detail. We'll start with what you see when you
first open Leo, Leo's main window. Leo's main window, shown below, represents an
entire project. As you can see, the main window contains three panes: the
**outline pane** at the top left, the **log pane** at the top right, and the
**body pane** at the bottom. The window also contains an **icon area** at the
very top, a **status area** and a **mini-buffer** at the very bottom.

|leoMainWindow|

The outline pane
    The outline pane shows your project as an outline. The outline
    contains all your project's data. An outline consists of **nodes**. The
    **icon box** is a small icon directly to the left of the headline text. If a
    node contains children, a smaller icon appears to the left of the icon box.
    This icon contains a '+' or '-' symbol. Clicking this **expansion box**
    expands or contracts the node.
    
Nodes
    Nodes have two parts, a **headline** and **body text**. The outline pane
    shows headlines. Selecting a headline selects the entire node; the node's
    body text appears in the body pane. Leo uses standard terminology to
    describe the relationships of nodes in an outline. We speak of **parent**
    nodes, **child** nodes, **ancestor** nodes and **descendant** nodes.

Body pane
    The body pane contains the body text of the node selected in the
    outline pane.

Log pane
    The log pane contains informational messages from Leo or your scripts.

Icon area Depending on what plugins are enabled, the icon area may contain
    buttons and other widgets that extend what Leo can do. The scripting plugin
    makes it easy to add buttons to the icon area.

Status area
    The status area shows the line and column containing the body text's cursor,
    and the **UNL** (Uniform Node Location), the path from the top of the outline
    to the selected node.  This path will change as you change outline nodes.

Mini-buffer
    You can type command and search strings in the minibuffer. It works much
    like the Emacs mini-buffer. To enter a command, type &lt;Alt-x&gt; followed by the
    command name and then &lt;return&gt;. To type a search string, type &lt;ctrl-f&gt;
    followed by the search string and then &lt;return&gt;. For full details, see
    `Chapter 5: Using Leo's Commands`_.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091130111843.6816">You can use Leo as fairly typical outliner. Play around with some of the
commands from the Outline menu:

- Click the expansion box of nodes to show and hide their children.

- The Insert Node command (Ctrl+I) inserts a new headline into the outline.

- The Cut Node command (Ctrl+Shift+X) deletes a headline and all its children,
  and copies the structure to clipboard - ready to paste with Paste Node command
  (Ctrl+Shift+V). Use the Copy Node command (Ctrl+Shift+C) to copy node to
  clipboard without deleting it from outline. Copy-paste command family works
  across different Leo documents.

- The Move Up (Ctrl+U), Move Down (Ctrl+D), Move Left (Ctrl+L) and Move Right
  (Ctrl+R) commands move the currently selected node, along with all its
  descendants.

- The Promote (Ctrl+}) command makes all the children of a headline siblings of
  the headline. The Demote (Ctrl+{) command makes all following siblings of a
  headline children of the headline.

- Move around the tree and expand/collapse nodes by pressing Alt + arrow keys.
  This also moves the focus to tree, so, after pressing Alt + arrow, you can
  move around by using arrow keys alone. Return the focus to the body control by
  pressing Enter.

- To edit the headline, use press Ctrl+H. This works regardless of whether body
  or headline has focus.

- We'll discuss the Clone Node command in the next section.

You enter body text for any node by selecting the node's headline in the outline
pane and then typing in the body pane. Leo has a full range of `editing
commands`_ that apply to the body pane.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091130111843.6817">A **clone** is a node that appears in more than one place in a Leo outline.
Clones are marked with a small red arrow in the icon box. All clones of a node
are actually *the same node*, so any change to one clone affects all clones. For
example, inserting, moving or deleting any child of a clone will change all
other clones on the screen.

Please take a few moments to experiment with clones. Create a node whose
headline is A. Clone node A using the Clone Node command in Leo's Outline menu.
Type some text into the body of either clone of A. The same text appears in the
bodies of all other clones of A. Now insert a node, say B, as a child of any of
the A nodes. All the A nodes now have a B child. See what happens if you clone
B. See what happens if you insert, delete or move nodes that are children of A.
Verify that when you delete the penultimate clone, the last clone becomes a
regular node again.

Clones are much more than a cute feature. Clones allow multiple views of data to
exist **within a single outline**. With Leo, there is no such thing as a single,
"correct" view of data. You can have as many views of data as you like.

To create a new view of the data in your outline, just do the following:

1. Create an *ordinary* node, that will represent the view. We call these nodes
   **view nodes** merely to indicate they represent a view.
   
2. Clone all the nodes from the outline that you want the view to contain. Move
   these clones so they become children of the view node.
   
3. (Optional) You can add regular nodes as children of the view node too.
   
For example, when I fix a bug in Leo, I create an ordinary node to represent the
bug. This **bug node** is my view of all the data in Leo's source code that
relates to the bug. As I discover code related to the bug, I clone their nodes
and move them under the bug node. I'll also add ordinary nodes as children of
the bug node. These nodes contain the original bug report, descriptions of how I
fixed the bug, test data, or any other notes I might want to keep.

Once I have created the bug node, I concentrate *only* on that node and its
children. I can examine the bug node and its children without having to jump
around the outline. Everything I need is in one place. When I get around to
actually fixing the bug I can do so by changing the clones. Again, I do not have
to jump around the outline. It doesn't matter how big or complex the entire
outline is: I am only dealing with the bug node and its children. This extremely
narrow focus makes it *much* easier to fix bugs.

By the way, I never have to remember to save external files. When I change any
clone, Leo marks all instances of that clone throughout the entire outline as
dirty (changed). When I save the Leo outline, Leo automatically writes all the
external files that contain dirty nodes.

Views have an unlimited number of uses. Use them whenever you want to focus your
attention on some smaller set of nodes. For example, I often create view nodes
when studying other people's code. The view node helps me concentrate on just
the part of the code that interests me at the moment.

<t tx="ekr.20091130111843.6838">.. _style:

Newcomers to Leo frequently ask when to use the \@others directive and when to
use sections. It is good style to use section references only when the order of
text within a external file matters. For example, Python programmers put
docstrings and imports at the start of files. So the body text of
\@file nodes typically look something like this::

    &lt;&lt; docstring &gt;&gt;
    @language python
    @tabwidth -4
    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;
    @others

This ensures that the docstring is first in the file, followed by imports,
followed by everything else. Note that the order in which functions are defined
in a file, or methods defined within a class, typically does *not* matter. Thus,
it is good style to define classes like this::

  class myClass:
        &lt;&lt; class attributes &gt;&gt;
        @others

It would be bad style to define a class like this::

  class myClass:
        &lt;&lt; class attributes &gt;&gt;
        &lt;&lt; method 1 &gt;&gt;
        &lt;&lt; method 2 &gt;&gt;
        ...

Not only does this over-specify the order in which methods are defined, but it
requires lots of extra typing. Not only must you add a line for each method, but
headlines must contain section names such as &lt;&lt; method 1 &gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;method 2&gt;&gt;, etc.
When using \@others it is good style simply to put the name of each method in the
headline.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091130111843.6839">A few more words about style:

- It is good style to put each class, function or method in its own node. This
  makes it easy to see the shape of your code.

- It is good style to use organizer nodes to group related functions or methods.
  An organizer node has no content except maybe for comments. Like this::

    + myClass
        + birth and death
            + __init__
            etc.
        + getters
            etc.
        + setters
            etc.
        + misc methods
            etc.

  (In this notation, '+' denotes a headline.) This organization is far superior
  to using hideous comments like::

    ###########
    # Getters #
    ###########

- It is bad style to use \@others in organizer nodes. There is no need to do so.

- It is bad style to use \@others when order does matter. The reason is that it
  is very easy to move nodes in a tree by mistake, say by alphabetizing nodes.
  One wants to make the meaning of a external file immune from such movements.

One last word about style. The world won't end if you happen to use bad style by
mistake: you just might cause a bit more work for yourself than was strictly
necessary. Feel free to invent your own style of using Leo. Still, it would be
wise to "know the rules before you break them."
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091130111843.6840">.. _scripting:

Leo is fully scriptable using the Python language. Leo can execute any body text
as a Python script. To run the entire body text as a script, simply choose the
node and execute the Execute Script command (Ctrl+B). If text is selected, the
Execute Script command will run just the selected text as the script.

The Execute Script command **preprocesses** the script before executing it, in
exactly the same way that Leo writes external files. Leo expands section
references and processes \@others directives before executing the script. This
allows you to use all of Leo's outlining capabilities to organize your scripts.

Your Python scripts can easily access data in an outline. Leo's execute-script
(Ctrl-B) command predefines three variables, c, g and p, that scripts can use to
easily access any part of any Leo outline, and Leo's own source code. For
example, the following script will print all the headlines in an outline::

    for p in c.all_positions():
        print ' '*p.level(),p.h

The example above is only the beginning of what scripts can do. See `Chapter 7:
Scripting Leo with Python`_ for a complete discussion of scripting Leo.

.. _extending:

**Plugins** are Python modules that change how Leo works. Leo's user have
contributed dozens of plugins that have extended Leo's capabilities in many new
directions. The file leoPlugins.leo contains all plugins that are included in
Leo distributions.

.. _config:

Plugins and other parts of Leo can get options from **@settings** trees.
\@settings trees allow plugins to get options without any further support from
Leo's core code. For a full discussion of \@settings trees, see `Chapter 8:
Customizing Leo`_.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091130111843.6843">LeoPyRef.leo (in the core subdirectory of the leo folder) contains almost all of
Leo's source code. It provides hundreds of examples of everything discussed
here. This file will repay close study. For full details on all aspects of Leo
see LeoDocs.leo or `Leo's Users Guide`_.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091130111843.6846">.. _`external files`:

Leo stores outline data on your file system in **.leo files**. The format of
these files is `XML`_. You don't have to store all your data in .leo files: Leo
allows you to store parts of your outline data **external files**, that is,
other files on your file system.

**@file nodes** create external files. \@file nodes have headlines starting with
\@file followed by a file name. Some examples::

    @file leoNodes.py
    @file ../../notes.text
    
The file name can be an absolute path or a relative path to the file that starts
at Leo's **load directory**, the directory containing the .leo file.

Leo reads and writes external files automatically when you open or save your Leo
outline:

- When you open an outline (.leo file) Leo reads all the external files created
  by the \@file nodes in the outline. If you have changed an external file
  outside of Leo, Leo will update the corresponding \@file tree to reflect those
  changes when Leo next opens the outline.

- When you save your outline, Leo writes all **dirty** \@file nodes. An \@file
  is dirty if the node or any of its descendant nodes has changed.
  **Important**: When Leo writes an external file, Leo writes all the essential
  information in the \@file tree to the external file, *not* to the .leo file.
  The only nodes that gets written to the .leo file are nodes that are not
  contained in any \@file tree.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091130194648.6811">Leo's **directives** control such things as syntax coloring, line wrapping
within the body pane and the width of tabs. Leo directives may appear in
headlines or body text. Leo directives start with '@' in the leftmost column,
followed by the name of the directive. Here are some of Leo's directives::

    @language python
    @tabwidth -4
    @wrap
    @nowrap
    @color
    @nocolor
    @killcolor
    
Directives apply until overridden in a subtree. All of these directives apply to
the node they are contained in, and also to the entire tree of descendant nodes,
unless **over-ridden** by a similar directive in a descendant node. For example,
the directive::

    @language python
    
tells Leo to syntax color the node and all descendant nodes as Python code.
However, some descendant node mignt contain::

    @language rest
    
which tells Leo to color that node and all of *its* decendants as
reStructureText. This principle applies to almost all of Leo's directives: the
directive is in effect throughout a tree, unless overridden in some subtree.

- **\@color**, **\@nocolor** and **\@killcolor** control syntax coloring.

  You can mix \@nocolor and \@color directives in a single node, but these
  directives apply to descendant nodes only if they are **unambiguous**, that
  is, only if the ancestor node contains exactly one \@color or \@nocolor
  directive.

- **\@encoding** Sets the Unicode encoding used in external files.

- **\@first** directives orces lines to appear before the first sentinel of a
  external file.

    This directive may only appear in \@&lt;file&gt; nodes. A common use of \@first
    directives is to add shebang lines::
    
        @first #! /usr/bin/env python
        
    or Python encoding specifications::
    
        @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

- **\@language** Sets the language used for syntax coloring **and** sets the
  comment delimiters used in sentinel lines and in doc parts. Some examples::

    @language python
    @language c
    @language rest # restructured text
    @language plain # text, that is, no syntax coloring.

- **\@last** Forces lines to appear after the last sentinel of a external file.

- **\@lineending** Specifies the line ending to be used in external files.

- **\@pagewidth** Sets the page width used to break doc parts into lines.

- **\@path** Sets the path to be prepended to filenames in descendant \@file
  nodes.

- **\@tabwidth** sets the width of tabs.

  Negative tab widths cause Leo to convert tabs to spaces and are highly
  recommended for Python programming.

- **\@wrap** and **\@nowrap** enable or disable line wrapping the Leo's body pane.

Leo treats lines starting with \@ as a normal code line unless the \@ starts a
Leo directive. In particular, Leo will output Python decorators correctly,
provided the name of the decorator does not conflict with a Leo directive.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091201091455.6809">We come now to one of Leo's most important and unusual features. When Leo writes
an external file, it does so in a flexible manner, directed by **outline-based
markup**. This markup tells Leo exactly how to create the external file from an
\@file node.

The **obvious** way to write an external file would be to write the \@file node
itself followed by all the descendant nodes in **outline order** (the order in
which nodes appear in the outline). But Leo does *not* write external files
exactly this way.

Yes, Leo does indeed start by writing the \@file node itself. But Leo writes the
\@file node's descendants only only when it sees one of three kinds of Leo
markup: section references, the \@others directive and the \@all directive.
We'll discuss these three kinds of markup in the next section.

Section references and the \@others and \@all directives tell Leo to write the
**expansion** of one or more descendant nodes to the external file. Programmers
will recognize this process as akin to macro expansion. The following sections
will explain this process in detail.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091201091455.6813">A **section reference** is a line of body text of the form::

    &lt;&lt; a section name &gt;&gt;
    
Here, "a section name" can be any descriptive text not containing "&gt;&gt;". When Leo
encounters a section reference, Leo searches all the descendants of the node
containing the reference looking for a node whose headline matches the section
reference. That is, Leo looks for a descendant node whose headline starts with::

     &lt;&lt; a section name &gt;&gt;
     
We call such nodes **named nodes**. Leo doesn't require an exact match. Leo
ignores whitespace and the case of letters when comparing headlines to section
reference. Also, Leo ignores anything that may follow the section name in a
named node. For example, the following headline will match the section reference
above::

    &lt;&lt; A Section Name &gt;&gt; (to do)

If Leo does find a match, Leo *replaces* the section reference ("&lt;&lt; a section
name&gt;&gt;") by the *expansion* of the body text of the matched node. That is, Leo
replaces the section reference by the body text of the matched node, but Leo
**expands all markup** in the matched node *before* making the replacement. The
entire expansion of the matched node replaces the original section reference.
Programmers will recognize this process as recursive macro expansion.

We have just discussed what happens if Leo does find a descendant named node
that matches the section reference. If no such match is found the section
reference is said to be **undefined** and Leo does not write any data to the
external file. This is *not* a serious error: Leo will will save the erroneous
\@&lt;file&gt; tree in the .leo file instead of the external file. No information is
lost. By the way, Leo's syntax coloring will indicate undefined section
reference by underlining the section name.

**Important**: the indentation of section references matters. When expanding a
section reference, Leo indents every line of the expansion by the leading
whitespace that occurs before the section reference. Note also that you can't
write something after a section reference and expect it to end up on the same
line after expansion--Leo always writes a newline after the expansion.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091201091455.6814">The **@others directive** is the second (and most common) way of including
descendant nodes in an external files. When Leo encounters the \@others
directive it replaces the \@others directive by the *expansion* of all
**unnamed** descendant nodes. As with section references, Leo replaces all
markup in the descendant nodes, and the entire expansion replaces the \@others
directive.

In short, section references write *named* nodes; \@others directives write all
*unnamed* nodes. By the way, no node may contain more than one \@others
directive because there would be no way to "apportion" descendant nodes to more
than one \@others directive. However, nodes may contain as many section
references as you like.

As with section references, the indentation of the \@others directive matters.
This allows Leo to handle Python source code properly. For exmple, the following
is a common way of representing a Python class::

    class myClass:
        '''a docstring'''
        @others
        
When Leo writes this node to an external file, Leo will write the first two
lines to the external file, with the indentation in effect for the node. Leo
will then write all descendant nodes to the external files, with *additional*
indentation equal to the leading whitespace appearing before the \@others
directive.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091201091455.6815">The \@all directive is the third, simplest (and least common) way of including
descendant nodes. This directive causes Leo to write all descendant nodes in
outline order, regardless of whether they are named or not. Furthermore, the
\@all directive does not expand any markup in descendant nodes. This results in
Leo writing the external file in the "obvious" way. That is, Leo writes all
descendant nodes in outline order.

Use the all directive if your external file contains unrelated nodes. For
example, I use an external file to store programming notes. These notes
typically contain snippets of programming source code, but there is no real
relationships between the snippets--the file is simply a grab bag of
information. The \@all directive is designed for this situation.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091216113613.6638">Create buttons to quickly move nodes to other nodes

Quickly move nodes from around the tree to one or more target nodes.

Adds 'Move/Clone/Copy To Last Child Button' and 'Move/Clone/Copy To First Child
Button' commands to the Move submenu on the Outline menu, and the context menu,
if contextmenu.py is enabled.

Select a node 'Foo' and then use the 'To Last Child Button' command. The adds a
'to Foo' button to the button bar. Now select another node and click the 'to
Foo' button. The selected node will be moved or cloned to the last child of the
node 'Foo'.

'To First Child Button' works the same way, except that moved nodes are inserted
as the first child of the target node.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20091222125456.6641">Using Leo quickly becomes second nature:

- You can use Leo like any ordinary outliner, as a filing cabinet, but Leo's
  clones makes this filing cabinet much more flexible and useful than usual.

- You create external files using \@file trees. Within \@file trees, you use
  section references and the \@others directive to tell Leo how to write nodes
  to the external file. Directives such as \@tabwidth and \@language provide other
  information to Leo. Leo's \@file trees allow you to organize your scripts
  and programs with Leo's outline structure.
  
- You can execute Python scripts from any node in a Leo outline. Leo scripts
  have full, easy, access to all the information in the outline. Using scripts
  and plugins, you can easily add new features to Leo.</t>

Leo 4.7 release beta 1 is now available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo 4.7 beta 1 fixes all known serious bugs in Leo.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.7:
--------------------------

- Leo now uses the simplest possible internal data model.
  This is the so-called "one-node" world.
- Leo supports Python 3.x.
- Leo requires Python 2.6 or above.
- Several important improvements in file handling.
    - Leo converts @file nodes to @thin nodes automatically.
    - Leo creates a 'Recovered Nodes' node to hold data that
      otherwise might be lost due to clone conflicts.
    - @auto-rst now works much more reliably reliably.
    - Leo no longer @noref trees.  Such trees are not
      reliable in cooperative environments.
- A new Windows installer.
- Many other features, including new command line options and new plugins.
- Dozens of bug fixes.

<t tx="ekr.20100122073254.11655">This section describes the process of creating an importer for a new language.
There are a set of "importers" in leoImport.py, all based on the
baseScannerClass class. You can define your own importer by creating a subclass.
This shouldn't be too difficult: baseScannerClass is supposed to do almost all
the work. With luck, your subclass might be very simple, as with class cScanner.

**Important** As I write this, I realize that I remember very little about the
code, but I do remember its general organization and the process of creating a
new importer. The following should be all you need to write any importer.

This base class has three main parts:

1. The "parser" that recognizes where nodes begin and end.

2. The "code generator" the actually creates the imported nodes.

3. Checking code that ensures that the imported code is equivalent
   to the original code.

You should never have to change the code generators or the checking code.
Confine your attention to the parser.

The parser thinks it is looking for classes, and within classes,
method definitions.  Your job is to tell the parser how to do this.
Let's look at part of the ctor for baseScannerClass for clues::

   # May be overridden in subclasses.
   self.anonymousClasses = [] # For Delphi Pascal interfaces.
   self.blockCommentDelim1 = None
   self.blockCommentDelim2 = None
   self.blockCommentDelim1_2 = None
   self.blockCommentDelim2_2 = None
   self.blockDelim1 = '{'
   self.blockDelim2 = '}'
   self.blockDelim2Cruft = [] # Stuff that can follow .blockDelim2.
   self.classTags = ['class',] # tags that start a tag.
   self.functionTags = []
   self.hasClasses = True
   self.hasFunctions = True
   self.lineCommentDelim = None
   self.lineCommentDelim2 = None
   self.outerBlockDelim1 = None
   self.outerBlockDelim2 = None
   self.outerBlockEndsDecls = True
   self.sigHeadExtraTokens = [] # Extra tokens valid in head of signature.
   self.sigFailTokens = []
       # A list of strings that abort a signature when seen in a tail.
       # For example, ';' and '=' in C.
   self.strict = False # True if leading whitespace is very significant.

Naturally, this looks like gibberish at first. I do *not* remember what all
these things do in detail, although obviously the names mean something. What I
*do* remember is that these ivars control the operation of the startsFunction
and startsClass methods and their helpers (especially startsHelper) and
the methods that call them, scan and scanHelper. Most of these methods have a
trace var that will enable tracing during importing.

So the strategy is simple: study startsHelper in detail, set the ivars above to
make startsHelper do what you want, and trace until things work as you want.

There is one more detail. Sometimes the ivars above are not sufficient to get
the job done. In that case, subclasses will override various methods of the
parser, but *not* the code generator. If indentation is important, you will want
to look at the Python importer. Notice that it overrides skipCodeBlock, called
by startsHelper.

That's about it. It would be pointless to give you more details, because those
details would lead you *away* from the process you need to follow. Having said
that, feel free to ask further questions. I'll be glad to answer them.</t>

It looks like you should be able to put the following in an
@font node, and get restructured text bold to appear in bold onscreen:

rest_keyword2_font_size = 16
rest_keyword2_font_family = Bitstream Charter
rest_keyword2_font_slant = roman
rest_keyword2_font_weight = bold

However nothing happens when I do this. The python examples in the
test.leo file work fine for me, so I'm not sure what's gone wrong.

I think that the following should also work, but it's also currently
not doing anything for me:

@color rest_keyword2_color = black

==================

Rev 2706 fixes a significant colorizer bug that caused your problem.
Previously, the colorizer inited the so-called configuration tags only
once, which is wrong. These tags are what the @font settings specify.
Now, the colorizer inits the tags when the language changes when
switching nodes.  Usually the language doesn't change, so the new code
will be approximately as fast as the old.

The problem occurs because the QtGui.QLineEdit object goes away
when the minibuffer gets focus and the QTreeWidget loses focus.

The fix: add a 'permanent' ivar to leoQtTextWidgets, and set
this ivar to False for headline widgets.</t>

1) Create an @thin file based outline.
2) In the @thin file, create an unreferenced section (something like a
  header &lt;&lt;This Section Is Bogus&gt;&gt;).
3) Now, File-&gt;Exit
4) A dialog box pops up
  (Save changes to leo_file.leo before quitting? Yes/No/Cancel)
5) Click "Yes"
6) In the log pane, you will see: "undefined section" and "saved: leo_file.leo"
  and in the console window, you see "undefined section: ..."

The point is that I can't kill Leo if I keep saying "Yes" to the
"Save change before quitting" dialog. This is definitely not the
intended behavior. The correct behavior would be to save the file,
give me the warning about the undefined section, and exit.

EKR: The fix was simple: write_leo_file ignores the status returned from
c.atFileCommands.writeAll.

Note that Leo writes the write error to the console as well as the log pane,
so this should be safe enough.</t>

I also unhappily discovered that any file named somedoc.leo.bak will
get deleted whenever you save a file named somedoc.leo.

This turned into a major refactoring of write_Leo_file.</t>

Current leo trunk, r2732, Slackware Linux

- I go to /tmp in terminal
- there is no aaa.leo there (this is important, see below why)
- I launch leo (the current working directory is /tmp)
- I select "File-&gt;Save as" menu item
- the save file dialog opens in /tmp, this is correct
- I type in the file name "aaa" then hit "Save" button
- leo dumps an error in the log pane:

exception renaming /tmp/aaa.leo to /tmp/tmpbNydoS
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/tmp/aaa.leo'

<t tx="ekr.20100129054823.11928">- Leo now treats @file nodes just like it treats @thin nodes. This makes Leo
  much safer to use in cooperative environments that use source code control
  systems. As part of this change, Leo no longer supports @noref nodes.

- @auto-rst now works much more reliably.

- Leo now has a simple, robust, and extremely useful scheme to recover from
  clone conflicts, no matter how they may arise. This removes all the dread from
  "node changed" messages. It is easy to see what the changes were, and it is
  easy to choose what, if anything to do.

  When a clone conflict occurs, you will see a red message in the log pane and a
  "Recovered Nodes" node as the last top-level node. This node has one child per
  red message. Each of these children contains two nodes: an "old" node and a
  "new" node. Unless there are multiple conflicts for a single node, the "new"
  node will have "won": every clone contains the new node's headline and body
  text. All these nodes are plain nodes, *not* clones. It is up to you to change
  the corresponding clone nodes if you choose to do so.

- Leo minimizes unnecessary changes to .leo files. Leo writes outline-size and
  orientation to the cache in your .leo directory. This eliminates unnecessary
  changes to .leo files.

- Leo now creates temporary files in the systems standard temporary directory.
  This prevents Leo from over-writing user-generated .bak files.

Leo 4.7 beta 3 is now available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo 4.7 beta 3 fixes all known serious bugs in Leo.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.7:
--------------------------

- Leo now uses the simplest possible internal data model.
  This is the so-called "one-node" world.
- Leo supports Python 3.x.
- Leo requires Python 2.6 or above.
- Several important improvements in file handling.
    - Leo converts @file nodes to @thin nodes automatically.
    - @auto-rst now works much more reliably reliably.
    - Leo no longer @noref trees.  Such trees are not
      reliable in cooperative environments.
- A new Windows installer.
- Many other features, including new command line options and new plugins.
- Dozens of bug fixes.

<t tx="ekr.20100205152016.14054">Leo now has a simple, robust, and extremely useful scheme to recover from clone
battles, no matter how they may arise. This removes all the dread from "node
changed" messages. It is easy to see what the changes were, and it is easy to
choose what, if anything to do.

It is easy to test the code to see how it works:

1. Put a clone in an external file, and put another clone in Leo
outside of any external file.

2. Change the clone outside of Leo using an external editor.

3. Reload Leo.

When a clone conflict occurs, you will see a red message in the log pane and a
"Recovered Nodes" node as the last top-level node. This node has one child per
red message. Each of these children contains two nodes: an "old" node and a
"new" node. Unless there are multiple conflicts for a single node, the "new"
node will have "won": every clone contains the new node's headline and body
text. All these nodes are plain nodes, *not* clones. It is up to you to change
the corresponding clone nodes if you choose to do so.</t>

If a @path directive is within the body text of an @thin node then the
file write uses the @path directive but the file read does not.  Since
the file read cannot know of the @path directive until after it has
read the file it has no choice but to not use it.  The @thin file
write code should not use any @path declarations found in its body
text.

What I did:

- Defined g.app.atPathInBodyWarning, set by g.get_directives_dict to p.h
- g.get_directives_dict also sets d['@path_in_body'] = p.h
- c.scanAtPathDirectives doesn't set the path if d['@path_in_body'] is true.
- atFile.scanAllDirectives issues a warning if g.app.atPathInBodyWarning is true,
  but only if the issuePathWarning keyword arg is true.</t>

What I did:

- fc.createBackupFile now calls shutils.move directly,
  avoiding g.utils_rename which does way too much:
  it calls g.makeAllNonExistentDirectories(!!)

- Simplified g.utils_rename.  We can assuem shutils exists.

- Removed an unwise call to g.utils_remove in g.utils_rename.
  This could cause havoc with the following call to
  shutils_move!!

Removed call to g.makeAllNonExistentDirectories in g.utils_rename.

This has global effects. Happily, there were only three callers of g.utils_rename:

- handleWriteLeoFileException: should *not* create directories.

- x.rename: no longer used!

- g.update_file_if_changed:
    - called only from tangle.put_all_roots.
    - I added call to g.makeAllNonExistentDirectories there.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20100225102026.7140">- Fixed a dangerous bug that could cause data loss when converting @file nodes
  from file-like to thin-like sentinels. The problem arose because it was too
  easy to save the .leo file (thus deleting the tnodeList) without forcing the
  converted external files to be saved. The next time Leo attempted to read the
  external files, the tnodeList would be missing and data would be lost.
  
  Leo's read logic now determines whether the file has file-like sentinels by
  reading the *uncached* contents of the file. When converting file-like
  sentinels to thin-like sentinels, Leo warns that it is converting the file and
  sets the @file node dirty. This ensures that Leo will write the converted
  external file whenever Leo writes the .leo file. This will make it impossible
  for a naive user to lose data. A sophisticated user might cause problems by
  using the write-outline-only command...

- Fixed expand/contract-pane commands.

- Fixed Python 3.x problems in delete-editor and cycle-editor-focus.

- Added a log message for show-colors saying the color picker does not exist for qt.

- Corrected date in trunk/license.txt.</t>
<t tx="shadow.20080825171547.9">**Question**: I must follow a coding standard when writing source code. It
includes a maximum line length restriction. How can I know the length of a
line when it gets written to the external file?

**Answer**: If a node belongs to a external file hierarchy, its body might get
indented when it is written to the external file. It happens when an
\@others directive or a section name appears indented in a higher-level
node body. While (**line**, **col**) in status area show the line and column
containing the body text's cursor, **fcol** shows the cursor coordinate
relative to the external file, not to the curent node. The relation
**fcol &gt;= col** is always true.</t>
<t tx="tbrown.20091203211538.14165">Makes \@path nodes "active".

With this plugin running, double clicking on \@path nodes
and their descendents synchronizes the node with the
filesystem.  If the node refers to a fodler (as the top
level \@path node always will), the folder's contents are
loaded as child nodes.  If it refers to a file, the file is
loaded as an @auto node.

For files not previously seen in a folder a new node will appear on top of
the children list (with a mark).

Folders appear in the list as /foldername/.  If you double click on the
icon-box of the folder node, it will have children added to it based on
the contents of the folder on disk.  These folders have the '@path' directive
as the first line of their body text.

When files are deleted from the folder and the list is updated by double
clicking the files will appear in the list as *filename* (or */foldername/*).

You can describe files and directories in the body of the nodes.

You can organize files and directories with organizer nodes, an organizer
node name cannot contain with '/'.

Files and folders can be created by entering a node with the required
name as its headline (must start and/or end with "/" for a folder)
and then double clicking on the node's status-iconbox.

@auto nodes can be set up for existing files can be loaded by
double clicking on the node's status-iconbox.  If you prefer
@shadow or something else use the "active_path_attype" setting,
without the "@".

There are commands on the Plugins active_path submenu:

    - show path - show the current path
    - set absolute path - changes a node "/dirname/" to "@path /absolute/path/to/dirname".
    - purge vanished (recursive) - remove *entries*
    - purge unoaded files (recursive) - remove *entries*
    - update recursive - recursive load of directories, use with caution on large
      file systems

If you want to use an input other than double clicking a node's status-iconbox
set active_path_event to a value like 'iconrclick1' or 'iconclick1'.


active_path is a rewrite of the at_directory plugin to use \@path directives (which influence
@auto and other @file type directives), and to handle sub-folders more automatically.

<t tx="ville.20090603183524.5672">You can use the @g.command decorator to create new commands. This is an easy-to-use
wrapper for c.k.registerCommand(), with the following advantages over it:

* The new command is automatically created for all Leo controllers (open Leo documents).

* The new command is also automatically available on all new Leo controllers 
  (documents that will be opened in the future).

* Prettier syntax.

Therefore, @g.command can be naturally 
prototyped with execute-script (Ctrl+b) in Leo node.

As an example, you can execute this script to make command hello available::

    @g.command('hello')
    def hello_f(event):
        # use even['c'] to access controller
        c = event['c']
        pos = c.currentPosition()
        g.es('hello from', pos.h)

If you want to create a plugin that only exposes new commands, this is basically all you need in the plugins .py file.
There is no need to hook up for 'after-create-leo-frame' just to make your commands available.

If you want to create a command in object oriented style (so that the commands deal with your own objects), 
create them using closures like this (note how self is available inside command functions)::

    class MyCommands:
        def create(self):        
            @g.command('foo1')
            def foo1_f(event):
               self.foo = 1

            @g.command('foo2')
            def foo2_f(event):
               self.foo = 2

            @g.command('foo-print')
            def foo_print_f(event):
               g.es('foo is', self.foo)

    o = MyCommands()
    o.create()

Note that running create() in this example in `after-create-leo-frame` is pointless - the
newly created commands will override the commands in all previous controllers. You should consider 
this in your plugin design, and create your commands only once per Leo session.</t>
<t tx="ville.20090704073251.9442">Define various useful actions for context menus (for Qt ui)

Examples are:

- Edit in $EDITOR
- Edit @thin node in $EDITOR (remember to do "refresh" after this!)
- Refresh @thin node from disk (e.g. after editing it in external editor)
- Go to clone

Here's an example on how to implement your own context menu items 
in your plugins::

    def nextclone_rclick(c,p, menu):
        """ Go to next clone """

        # only show the item if you are on a clone
        # this is what makes this "context sensitive"
        if not p.isCloned():
            return    

        def nextclone_rclick_cb():
            c.goToNextClone()

        # 'menu' is a QMenu instance that was created by Leo 
        # in response to right click on tree item

        action = menu.addAction("Go to clone")
        action.connect(action, QtCore.SIGNAL("triggered()"), nextclone_rclick_cb)

And call this in your plugin *once*::

    g.tree_popup_handlers.append(nextclone_rclick)    </t>

<t tx="vivainio.20080302174639.1">ILeo, or leo-ipython bridge, creates a two-way communication channel between Leo
and IPython. The level of integration is much deeper than conventional
integration in IDEs; most notably, you are able to store and manipulate **data**
in Leo nodes, in addition to mere program code - essentially making ILeo a
hierarchical spreadsheet, albeit with non-grid view of the data. The
possibilities of this are endless, and the approach can be applied in wide range
of problem domains with very little actual coding.

IPython users are accustomed to using things like %edit to produce non-trivial
functions/classes (i.e. something that they don't want to enter directly on the
interactive prompt, but creating a proper script/module involves too much
overhead). In ILeo, this task consists just going to the Leo window, creating a node
and writing the code there, and pressing alt+I (push-to-ipython).

Obviously, you can save the Leo document as usual - this is a great advantage
of ILeo over using %edit, you can save your experimental scripts all at one
time, without having to organize them into script/module files (before you
really want to, of course!)
</t>
<t tx="vivainio.20080302174639.2">You need at least Leo 4.4.8, and IPython 0.8.3

The ILeo concept is still being developed actively, so if you want to get access
to latest features you can get IPython from Launchpad by installing bzr and
doing::

    bzr branch lp:ipython
    cd ipython
    python setupegg.py develop

You need to enable the 'ipython.py' plugin in Leo: 

- Help -&gt; Open LeoSettings.leo

- Edit @settings--&gt;Plugins--&gt;@enabled-plugins, add/uncomment 'ipython.py'

- Alternatively, you can add @settings--&gt;@enabled-plugins with body ipython.py to your leo document.

- Restart Leo. Be sure that you have the console window open
  (`run Leo in a console window`_, or double-click leo.py on windows)

- When using the Qt ui, add --ipython argument to command line (e.g. launchLeo.py --ipython).

- Press alt+shift+i OR alt-x start-ipython to launch IPython in the console that
  started leo. You can start entering IPython commands normally, and Leo will keep
  running at the same time.

- Note that you can just press alt-I (push-to-ipython) - it will start IPython
  if it has not been previously started. However, when you open a new leo
  document, you have to execute start-ipython (alt+shift+I) again to tell
  IPython that the new commands should target the new document. IPython session
  will not be restarted, only the leo commander object is updated in the
  existing session.

- If you want to specify command line arguments to IPython (e.g. to choose a
  profile, or to start in 'pylab' mode), add this to your @settings:
  '@string ipython_argv = ipython -pylab' (where -pylab is the command line argument)</t>
<t tx="vivainio.20080302174639.3">IPython code
------------

Just enter IPython commands on a Leo node and press alt-I to execute
push-to-ipython in order to execute the script in IPython. 'commands' is
interpreted loosely here - you can enter function and class definitions, in
addition to the things you would usually enter at IPython prompt - calculations,
system commands etc.

Everything that would be legal to enter on IPython prompt is legal to execute
from ILeo.

Results will be shows in Leo log window for convenience, in addition to the console.

Suppose that a node had the following contents::

    1+2
    print "hello"
    3+4

    def f(x):
        return x.upper()

    f('hello world')

If you press alt+I on that node, you will see the following in Leo log window (IPython tab)::

    In: 1+2
    &lt;2&gt; 3
    In: 3+4
    &lt;4&gt; 7
    In: f('hello world')
    &lt;6&gt; 'HELLO WORLD'

(numbers like &lt;6&gt; mean IPython output history indices; the actual object can be
referenced with _6 as usual in IPython).


Plain Python code
-----------------

If the headline of the node ends with capital P, alt-I will not run the code
through IPython translation mechanism but use the direct python 'exec' statement
(in IPython user namespace) to execute the code. It wont be shown in IPython
history, and sometimes it is safer (and more efficient) to execute things as
plain Python statements. Large class definitions are good candidates for P
nodes.
</t>
<t tx="vivainio.20080302174639.4">The real fun starts when you start entering text to leo nodes, and are using
that as data (input/output) for your IPython work.

Accessing Leo nodes happens through the variable **wb** (short for "WorkBook")
that exist in the IPython user namespace. Nodes that are directly accessible are
the ones that have simple names which could also be Python variable names;
'foo_1' will be accessible directly from IPython, whereas 'my scripts' will not.
If you want to access a node with arbitrary headline, add a child node '@a foo'
(@a stands for 'anchor'). Then, the parent of '@a foo' is accessible through
'wb.foo'.

You can see what nodes are accessible be entering (in IPython) wb.&lt;TAB&gt;. Example::

    [C:leo/core]|12&gt; wb.
    wb.b           wb.tempfile    wb.rfile       wb.NewHeadline
    wb.bar         wb.Docs        wb.strlist     wb.csvr    
    [C:leo/core]|12&gt; wb.tempfile
                &lt;12&gt; &lt;ipy_leo.LeoNode object at 0x044B6D90&gt;

So here, we meet the 'LeoNode' class that is your key to manipulating Leo
content from IPython!

LeoNode
-------

Suppose that we had a node with headline 'spam' and body::

    ['12',2222+32]

we can access it from IPython (or from scripts entered into other Leo nodes!) by doing::

    C:leo/core]|19&gt; wb.spam.v
               &lt;19&gt; ['12', 2254]

'v' attribute stands for 'value', which means the node contents will be run
through 'eval' and everything you would be able to enter into IPython prompt
will be converted to objects. This mechanism can be extended far beyond direct
evaluation (see '@cl definitions').

'v' attribute also has a setter, i.e. you can do::

    wb.spam.v = "mystring"

Which will result in the node 'spam' having the following text::

    'mystring'

What assignment to 'v' does can be configured through generic functions
('simplegeneric' module, see ipy_leo.py for examples).

Besides v, you can set the body text directly through::

    wb.spam.b = "some\nstring", 

headline by::

    wb.spam.h = 'new_headline' 

(obviously you must access the node through wb.new_headline from that point
onwards), and access the contents as string list (IPython SList) through
'wb.spam.l'.

If you do 'wb.foo.v = 12' when node named 'foo' does not exist, the node titled
'foo' will be automatically created and assigned body 12.

LeoNode also supports go() that focuses the node in the Leo window, and ipush()
that simulates pressing alt+I on the node (beware of the possible recursion!).

You can access unknownAttributes by .uA property dictionary. Unknown attributes
allow you to store arbitrary (pickleable) python objects in the Leo nodes; the
attributes are stored when you save the .leo document, and recreated when you
open the document again. The attributes are not visible anywhere, but can be
used for domain-specific metadata. Example::

    [C:leo/core]|12&gt; wb.spam.uA['coords'] = (12,222)
    [C:leo/core]|13&gt; wb.spam.uA
                &lt;13&gt; {'coords': (12, 222)}    

Accessing children with iteration and dict notation
---------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, you may want to treat a node as a 'database', where the nodes
children represent elements in the database. You can create a new child node for
node 'spam', with headline 'foo bar' like this::

    wb.spam['foo bar'] = "Hello"

And assign a new value for it by doing::

    wb.spam['foo bar'].v = "Hello again"

Note how you can't use .v when you first create the node - i.e. the node needs
to be initialized by simple assignment, that will be interpreted as assignment
to '.v'. This is a conscious design choice.

If you try to do wb.spam['bar'] = 'Hello', ILeo will assign '@k bar' as the
headline for the child instead, because 'bar' is a legal python name (and as
such would be incorporated in the workbook namespace). This is done to avoid
crowding the workbook namespace with extraneous items. The item will still be
accessible as wb.spam['bar']

LeoNodes are iterable, so to see the headlines of all the children of 'spam' do::

    for n in wb.spam:
        print n.h
</t>
<t tx="vivainio.20080302174639.5">If the first line in the body text is of the form '@cl sometext', IPython will
evaluate 'sometext' and call the result with the rest of the body when you do
'wb.foo.v' or press alt+I on the node. An example is in place here. Suppose that we have defined a class (I
use the term class in a non-python sense here)::

    def rfile(body,node):
        """ @cl rfile 

        produces a StringIO (file like obj) of the rest of the body """

        import StringIO
        return StringIO.StringIO(body)

(note that node is ignored here - but it could be used to access headline,
children etc.),

Now, let's say you have node 'spam' with text::

    @cl rfile
    hello
    world
    and whatever

Now, in IPython, we can do this::

    [C:leo/core]|22&gt; f = wb.spam.v
    [C:leo/core]|23&gt; f
                &lt;23&gt; &lt;StringIO.StringIO instance at 0x04E7E490&gt;
    [C:leo/core]|24&gt; f.readline()
                &lt;24&gt; u'hello\n'
    [C:leo/core]|25&gt; f.readline()
                &lt;25&gt; u'world\n'
    [C:leo/core]|26&gt; f.readline()
                &lt;26&gt; u'and whatever'
    [C:leo/core]|27&gt; f.readline()
                &lt;27&gt; u''    

You should declare new @cl types to make ILeo as convenient your problem domain
as possible. For example, a "@cl etree" could return the elementtree object for
xml content.

In the preceding examples, the return value matter. That, of course, is optional.
You can just use the @cl node as a convenient syntax for "run this body text through 
a function". 

Consider this example::

    def remote(body, node):
        out = sshdo(body)
        c = node.append()
        c.b = "@nocolor\n" + out
        c.h = "Command output"

(sshdo(s) is a just a trivial function implemented using paramiko, that
returns the output from command run over ssh on remote host).

After running the above node (by, say, wb.require('remote_impl') if the function is 
declared in a node named 'remote_impl'), you can create nodes that have various 
little sysadmin tasks (grep the logs, gather data, kick out all the users) like this::

    @cl remote
    cd /var/log
    ls -l
    echo " --- temp ---"
    cd /var/tmp
    ls -l

Press alt+I on the node to run it. The output will be written to
"Command output" child node.</t>
<t tx="vivainio.20080302174639.6">@ipy-startup
------------

If this node exist, the *direct children* of this will be pushed to IPython when
ILeo is started (you press alt+shift-i). Use it to push your own @cl
definitions, import the modules you will be using elsewhere in the document, etc.

The contents of of the node itself will be ignored.


@ipy-results
------------

If you press alt+I on a node that has @cl, it will be evaluated and the result
will be put into this node. Otherwise, it will just be displayed in log tab.

@ipy-root
---------

You can set up a subportion of the leo document as a "sandbox" for your IPython
work. Only the nodes under @ipy-root will be visible through the 'wb' variable.

Also, when you create a new node (wb.foo.v = 'stuff'), the node foo will be created as
a child of this node. 

@a nodes
--------

You can attach these as children of existing nodes to provide a way to access
nodes with arbitrary headlines, or to provide aliases to other nodes. If
multiple @a nodes are attached as children of a node, all the names can be used
to access the same object.
</t>
<t tx="vivainio.20080302174639.7">Sometimes, you might want to configure what alt+I on a node does. You can do
that by creating your own push function and expose it using
ipy_leo.expose_ileo_push(f, priority). The function should check whether the
node should by handled by the function and raise IPython.ipapi.TryNext if it
will not do the handling, giving the next function in the chain a chance to see
whether it should handle the push.

This example would print an uppercase version of node body if the node headline ends
with U (yes, this is completely useless!)::

    def push_upcase(node):
        if not node.h.endswith('U'):
            raise TryNext
        print node.b.upper()

    ipy_leo.expose_ileo_push(push_upcase, 12)

(the priority should be between 0-100, with 0 being the highest (first one to
try) - typically, you don't need to care about it and can usually omit the
argument altogether)
</t>
<t tx="vivainio.20080302174639.8">Get list of all headlines of all the nodes in leo::

    [node.h for node in wb]

Create node with headline 'baz', empty body::

    wb.baz

Create 10 child nodes for baz, where i is headline and 'Hello ' + i is body::

    for i in range(10):
        wb.baz[i] = 'Hello %d' % i

Create 5 child nodes for the current node (note the use of special _p variable,
which means "current node") and moves focus to node number 5::

    for i in range(10):
        _p[i] = 'hello %d' % d
    _p[5].go()

Sort contents of a node in alphabetical order (after pushing this to
IPython, you can sort a node 'foo' in-place by doing sort_node(wb.foo))::

    def sort_node(n):
        lines = n.l
        lines.sort()
        n.l = lines
</t>
<t tx="vivainio.20080302174639.9">This idea got started when I (Ville M. Vainio) saw this post by Edward Ream (the author of
Leo) on IPython developer mailing list:

    http://lists.ipython.scipy.org/pipermail/ipython-dev/2008-January/003551.html

I was using FreeMind as mind mapping software, and so I had an immediate use
case for Leo (which, incidentally, is superior to FreeMind as mind mapper). The
wheels started rolling, I got obsessed with the power of this concept
(everything clicked together), and Edwards excitement paralleled mine.
Everything was mind-bogglingly easy/trivial, something that is typical of all
promising technologies.

Discussions_ on SourceForge show how the goal of close cooperation between Leo and IPython went from
vague dream to completed reality over the span of about 10 days.

<t tx="vivainio.20080302194307">%mb
---

Execute leo minibuffer command. Tab completion works. Example::

    mb open-outline

%lee
----

Stands for "LEo Edit". Allows you to open file(s), and even objects in Leo for editing. Examples::

    lee *.txt

Opens all txt files in @auto nodes

::

    lee MyMacro

Opens the macro MyMacro for editing. Press alt-I to push the edited macro back to IPython.

::

  s = 'hello word'
  lee s

Opens the variable s for editing. Press alt+I to push the new value to IPython.

::

    lee hist   

Opens IPython interactive history (both input and output) in Leo.
</t>
<t tx="vivainio.20080318125834.2">If you install matplotlib and numpy, you can use ILeo to interactively edit and
view your data. This is convenient for storing potentially valuable information
in Leo document, and yields an interactive system that is comparable in
convenience to various commercial mathematical packages (at least if you compare
it agains plain IPython, that forgets the data on exit unless explicitly saved
to data files or %store:d).

Startup
-------

It's probably safest to rely on TkAgg backend, to avoid two event loops running
in the same process. TkAgg is the default, so the only thing you need to do is
to install numpy and matplotlib::

    easy_install numpy
    easy_install matplotlib

Finally, you need to start up IPython with '-pylab' option. You can accomplish
this by having the following under some @settings node::

    @string ipython_argv = ipython -pylab

Then, you just need to press alt+I to launch IPython.

Usage
-----

The simplest use case is probably pushing an existing array to Leo for editing.
Let's generate a simple array and edit it::

    [c:/ipython]|51&gt; a = arange(12).reshape(3,4)
    [c:/ipython]|52&gt; a
    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
           [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
           [ 8,  9, 10, 11]])
    [c:/ipython]|53&gt; %lee a

This (the magic command %lee, or 'leo edit') will open variable 'a' for editing
in Leo, in a convenient pretty-printed format. You can press alt+I on the node
to push it back to IPython.

If you want to store the variable in a node with a different name (myarr), you can do::

    [c:/ipython]|54&gt; wb.myarr.v = a

Then, you can always get the value of this array with wb.myarr.v. E.g. you could
have a node that plots the array, with content::

    # press alt+i here to plot testarr

    plot(wb.myarr.v)

And, as per instructions, pressing alt+I will launch a new Tk window with the
plotted representation of the array!</t>
<t tx="vivainio.20080401152121.2">Sometimes you may decide to launch Leo when an IPython session is already
running. This is typically the case when IPython is launched from/as another
application (Turbogears/Django shell, Sage, etc.), or you only decide later on
that you might want to roll up some scripts or edit your variables in Leo.

Luckily, this is quite easy, if not automatic (yet) using IPython's %run command
that runs python code in the IPython process. The only special consideration is
that we need to run IPython.Shell.hijack_tk() to prevent Leo Tk mainloop from
blocking IPython in %run. Here we launch an embedded Leo instance, and create a
macro 'embleo' for later use (so that we don't have to repeat these steps)::

    IPython 0.8.3.bzr.r57   [on Py 2.5.1]
    [C:opt/Console2]|2&gt; import IPython.Shell
    [C:opt/Console2]|3&gt; IPython.Shell.hijack_tk()
    [C:opt/Console2]|4&gt; cd c:/leo.repo/trunk
    [c:leo/leo.repo/trunk]|5&gt; %run launchLeo.py

    reading settings in C:\leo\leo\config\leoSettings.leo

    ... Leo is starting at this point, but IPython prompt returns ...

    [c:leo/leo.repo/trunk]|6&gt; macro embleo 2-5

    [c:leo/leo.repo/trunk]|7&gt; store embleo
    Stored 'embleo' (Macro)

Now, in Leo, you only need to press Alt+Shift+I (launch-ipython) to actually
make the document visible in IPython. Despite the name, launch-ipython will not
create a new instance of IPython; if an IPython session already exists, it will
be automatically used by ILeo.</t>
<t tx="vivainio.20080409164902.1">Many users will want to track the development version of Leo, in order to stay
on top of the latest features and bugfixes. Running the development version is
quite safe and easy, and it's also a requirement if you want to contribute to
Leo.

1. First, you need to get Bazaar (bzr) from http://bazaar-vcs.org. For windows
   users we recommend the standalone installer - the python installer may have
   problems pushing to Launchpad. Plain bzr installer only contains the command
   line version, so you might want to augment that with a friendly GUI - qbzr is
   recommended as it's the easiest one to install. It provides command like
   bzr qlog, bzr qannotate etc.

2. Get Leo from launchpad by doing::

     bzr branch lp:leo-editor

And that's it! You can run leo/core/leo.py directly. When you want to refresh the
code with latest modifications from Launchpad, run bzr pull.

If you make modifications to Leo (with the interest in sharing them with the Leo
community), you can check them in to your local branch by doing bzr checkin.
Now, to actually request your changes to be merged to Leo trunk, you need a
Launchpad account with RSA keys in place. There is showmedo video about how to
accomplish this in Windows using puttygen and pageant at
http://showmedo.com/videos/video?name=1510070&amp;fromSeriesID=151.

After your Launchpad account is set up, go to
https://launchpad.net/leo-editor, choose "Code" tab -&gt; Register Branch,
select Branch type "Hosted" and fill in descriptive details about the branch.
After that, go to the branch home page from Code tab again, and copy-paste the
push command line to terminal. For example, for branch::

    https://code.launchpad.net/~leo-editor-team/leo-editor/mod_rclick

The push command is::

    bzr push bzr+ssh://my_name@bazaar.launchpad.net/~leo-editor-team/leo-editor/mod_rclick    

You may wish to add --remember command line option to bzr push, to direct all
future pushes to that location. Then, you only need to execute bzr push.

After your branch is pushed, you can email the Leo mailing list and request it
to be reviewed and merged to trunk.</t>
