http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/bd3e06a8a34a1938

This is the first time we have done this ("stable" branch + trunk),
so it might be good to bring this up:

- When doing a bugfix/improvement, always do it in the oldest branch that will
  receive it.

- Only after that, merge it to trunk

This prevents "manual" merges, and accidental incorporation of unwanted fixes.
It also gives us clean merge history.

I think this is the process python-the-project will use with mercurial. If they
find a bug in python 2.6.whatever, they fix it in that branch first, then merge
from that branch to trunk (so python 2.7 will receive it).

===================

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/3f24628c7f735c42

> I'll probably open a branch (based on the 4-6-final branch) to
  attempt a fix for an rst bug.

You don't need to create the branch on launchpad to do little fixes. The local
branch you create with "bzr branch" is a full-blown branch.

Here's how I do all my commits to trunk:

I have ~/leotrunk. I always keep this up to date with "bzr pull", but never
develop here.  (But I merge from leo-editor, as shown below.)
EKR: I call this main-trunk.

I have ~/leo-editor, also created from trunk. I develop here normally.
Occasionally, I just "bzr push", but often it fails because "branches have
diverged". I resist the temptation to "bzr merge" here, because it screws up
history. Rather, I:

- cd ~/leotrunk
- bzr pull (this always succeeds)
- bzr merge ~/leo-editor
- (investigate diffs)
- bzr qcommit (select the files I really want to commit--usually .py files)
- bzr push

Then, to get my ~/leo-editor up to date again:

cd ~/leo-editor
bzr pull

To check that pymacs-services is properly installed, type the following in a console::

Conversions

Whenever Emacs Lisp calls Python functions giving them arguments, these arguments are Emacs Lisp structures that should be converted into Python objects in some way. Conversely, whenever Python calls Emacs Lisp functions, the arguments are Python objects that should be received as Emacs Lisp structures. We need some conventions for doing such conversions.

Conversions generally transmit mutable Emacs Lisp structures as mutable objects on the Python side, in such a way that transforming the object in Python will effectively transform the structure on the Emacs Lisp side (strings are handled a bit specially however, see below). The other way around, Python objects transmitted to Emacs Lisp often loose their mutability, so transforming the Emacs Lisp structure is not reflected on the Python side.

Pymacs sticks to standard Emacs Lisp, it explicitly avoids various Emacs Lisp extensions. One goal for many Pymacs users is taking some distance from Emacs Lisp, so Pymacs is not overly pushing users deeper into it.
#@-node:ekr.20071103090504.2:Emacs lisp structures and Python
#@+node:ekr.20071103090504.3:Simple objects
Simple objects

Emacs Lisp nil and the equivalent Emacs Lisp () yield Python None. Python None and the Python empty list [] are returned as nil in Emacs Lisp.

Emacs Lisp numbers, either integer or floating, are converted in equivalent Python numbers. Emacs Lisp characters are really numbers and yield Python numbers. In the other direction, Python numbers are converted into Emacs Lisp numbers, with the exception of long Python integers and complex numbers.

Emacs Lisp strings are usually converted into equivalent Python narrow strings. As Python strings do not have text properties, these are not reflected. This may be changed by setting the pymacs-mutable-strings option : if this variable is not nil, Emacs Lisp strings are then transmitted opaquely. Python strings, except Unicode, are always converted into Emacs Lisp strings.

Emacs Lisp symbols yield the special lisp.symbol or lisp[string] notations on the Python side. The first notation is used when the Emacs Lisp symbol starts with a letter, and contains only letters, digits and hyphens, in which case Emacs Lisp hyphens get replaced by Python underscores. This convention is welcome, as Emacs Lisp programmers commonly prefer using dashes, where Python programmers use underlines. Otherwise, the second notation is used. Conversely, lisp.symbol on the Python side yields an Emacs Lisp symbol with underscores replaced with hyphens, while lisp[string] corresponds to an Emacs Lisp symbol printed with that string which, of course, should then be a valid Emacs Lisp symbol name.
#@-node:ekr.20071103090504.3:Simple objects
#@+node:ekr.20071103090504.4:Sequences
Sequences

The case of strings has been discussed in the previous section.

Proper Emacs Lisp lists, those for which the cdr of last cell is nil, are normally transmitted opaquely to Python. If pymacs-forget-mutability is set, or if Python later asks for these to be expanded, proper Emacs Lisp lists get converted into Python lists, if we except the empty list, which is always converted as Python None. In the other direction, Python lists are always converted into proper Emacs Lisp lists.

Emacs Lisp vectors are normally transmitted opaquely to Python. However, if pymacs-forget-mutability is set, or if Python later asks for these to be expanded, Emacs Lisp vectors get converted into Python tuples. In the other direction, Python tuples are always converted into Emacs Lisp vectors.

Remember the rule : Round parentheses correspond to square brackets!. It works for lists, vectors, tuples, seen from either Emacs Lisp or Python.

The above choices were debatable. Since Emacs Lisp proper lists and Python lists are the bread-and-butter of algorithms modifying structures, at least in my experience, I guess they are more naturally mapped into one another, this spares many casts in practice. While in Python, the most usual idiom for growing lists is appending to their end, the most usual idiom in Emacs Lisp to grow a list is by cons'ing new items at its beginning :

     (setq accumulator (cons 'new-item accumulator))


or more simply :

     (push 'new-item accumulator)


So, in case speed is especially important and many modifications happen in a row on the same side, while order of elements ought to be preserved, some (nreverse ...) on the Emacs Lisp side or .reverse() on the Python side side might be needed. Surely, proper lists in Emacs Lisp and lists in Python are the normal structure for which length is easily modified.

We cannot so easily change the size of a vector, the same as it is a bit more of a stunt to modify a tuple. The shape of these objects is fixed. Mapping vectors to tuples, which is admittedly strange, will only be done if the Python side requests an expanded copy, otherwise an opaque Emacs Lisp object is seen in Python. In the other direction, whenever an Emacs Lisp vector is needed, one has to write tuple(python_list) while transmitting the object. Such transmissions are most probably to be unusual, as people are not going to blindly transmit whole big structures back and forth between Emacs and Python, they would rather do it once in a while only, and do only local modifications afterwards. The infrequent casting to tuple for getting an Emacs Lisp vector seems to suggest that we did a reasonable compromise.

In Python, both tuples and lists have O(1) access, so there is no real speed consideration there. Emacs Lisp is different : vectors have O(1) access while lists have O(N) access. The rigidity of Emacs Lisp vectors is such that people do not resort to vectors unless there is a speed issue, so in real Emacs Lisp practice, vectors are used rather parsimoniously. So much, in fact, that Emacs Lisp vectors are overloaded for what they are not meant : for example, very small vectors are used to represent X events in key-maps, programmers only want to test vectors for their type, or users just like bracketed syntax. The speed of access is hardly an issue then.

Emacs Lisp handles

When a Python function is called from Emacs Lisp, the function arguments have already been converted to Python types from Emacs Lisp types and the function result is going to be converted back to Emacs Lisp.

Several Emacs Lisp objects do not have Python equivalents, like for Emacs windows, buffers, markers, overlays, etc. It is nevertheless useful to pass them to Python functions, hoping that these Python functions will operate on these Emacs Lisp objects. Of course, the Python side may not itself modify such objects, it has to call for Emacs services to do so. Emacs Lisp handles are a mean to ease this communication.

Whenever an Emacs Lisp object may not be converted to a Python object, an Emacs Lisp handle is created and used instead. Whenever that Emacs Lisp handle is returned into Emacs Lisp from a Python function, or is used as an argument to an Emacs Lisp function from Python, the original Emacs Lisp object behind the Emacs Lisp handle is automatically retrieved.

Emacs Lisp handles are either instances of the internal Lisp class, or of one of its subclasses. If object is an Emacs Lisp handle, and if the underlying Emacs Lisp object is an Emacs Lisp sequence, then whenever object[index], object[index] = value and len(object) are meaningful, these may be used to fetch or alter an element of the sequence directly in Emacs Lisp space. Also, if object corresponds to an Emacs Lisp function, object(arguments) may be used to apply the Emacs Lisp function over the given arguments. Since arguments have been evaluated the Python way on the Python side, it would be conceptual overkill evaluating them again the Emacs Lisp way on the Emacs Lisp side, so Pymacs manage to quote arguments for defeating Emacs Lisp evaluation. The same logic applies the other way around.

Emacs Lisp handles have a value() method, which merely returns self. They also have a copy() method, which tries to open the box if possible. Emacs Lisp proper lists are turned into Python lists, Emacs Lisp vectors are turned into Python tuples. Then, modifying the structure of the copy on the Python side has no effect on the Emacs Lisp side.

For Emacs Lisp handles, str() returns an Emacs Lisp representation of the handle which should be eq to the original object if read back and evaluated in Emacs Lisp. repr() returns a Python representation of the expanded Emacs Lisp object. If that Emacs Lisp object has an Emacs Lisp representation which Emacs Lisp could read back, then repr() value is such that it could be read back and evaluated in Python as well, this would result in another object which is equal to the original, but not neccessarily eq.
#@-node:ekr.20071103090504.6:Emacs lisp handles
#@+node:ekr.20071103090504.7:Python handles
Python handles

The same as Emacs Lisp handles are useful for handling Emacs Lisp objects on the Python side, Python handles are useful for handling Python objects on the Emacs Lisp side.

Many Python objects do not have direct Emacs Lisp equivalents, including long integers, complex numbers, Unicode strings, modules, classes, instances and surely a lot of others. When such are being transmitted to the Emacs Lisp side, Pymacs use Python handles. These are automatically recovered into the original Python objects whenever transmitted back to Python, either as arguments to a Python function, as the Python function itself, or as the return value of an Emacs Lisp function called from Python.

The objects represented by these Python handles may be inspected or modified using the basic library of Python functions. For example, in :

     (setq matcher (pymacs-eval "re.compile('pattern').match"))
     (pymacs-call matcher argument)


the initial setq above could be decomposed into :

           (setq compiled (pymacs-eval "re.compile('pattern')")
     	    matcher (pymacs-call "getattr" compiled "match"))


This example shows that one may use pymacs-call with getattr as the function, to get a wanted attribute for a Python object.

pymacs-eval

Function (pymacs-eval text) gets text evaluated as a Python expression, and returns the value of that expression converted back to Emacs Lisp.

pymacs-call

Function (pymacs-call function argument...) will get Python to apply the given function over zero or more argument. function is either a string holding Python source code for a function (like a mere name, or even an expression), or else, a Python handle previously received from Python, and hopefully holding a callable Python object. Each argument gets separately converted to Python before the function is called. pymacs-call returns the resulting value of the function call, converted back to Emacs Lisp.

pymacs-apply

Function (pymacs-apply function arguments) will get Python to apply the given function over the given arguments. arguments is a list containing all arguments, or nil if there is none. Besides arguments being bundled together instead of given separately, the function acts pretty much like pymacs-call.

We do not expect that pymacs-eval, pymacs-call or pymacs-apply will be much used, if ever. In practice, the Emacs Lisp side of a Pymacs application might call pymacs-load a few times for linking into the Python modules, with the indirect effect of defining trampoline functions for these modules on the Emacs Lisp side, which can later be called like usual Emacs Lisp functions.
#@-node:ekr.20071103090504.9:pymacs-eval/apply
#@+node:ekr.20071103090504.10:pymacs-load
pymacs-load

Function (pymacs-load module prefix) imports the Python module into Emacs Lisp space.

module is the name of the file containing the module, without any .py or .pyc extension. If the directory part is omitted in module, the module will be looked into the current Python search path. Dot notation may be used when the module is part of a package. Each top-level function in the module produces a trampoline function in Emacs Lisp having the same name, except that underlines in Python names are turned into dashes in Emacs Lisp, and that prefix is uniformly added before the Emacs Lisp name (as a way to avoid name clashes).

prefix may be omitted, in which case it defaults to base name of module with underlines turned into dashes, and followed by a dash.

Whenever pymacs_load_hook is defined in the loaded Python module, pymacs-load calls it without arguments, but before creating the Emacs view for that module. So, the pymacs_load_hook function may create new definitions or even add interaction attributes to functions.

The return value of a successful pymacs-load is the module object. An optional third argument, noerror, when given and not nil, will have pymacs-load to return nil instead of raising an error, if the Python module could not be found.

When later calling one of these trampoline functions, all provided arguments are converted to Python and transmitted, and the function return value is later converted back to Emacs Lisp. It is left to the Python side to check for argument consistency. However, for an interactive function, the interaction specification drives some checking on the Emacs Lisp side. Currently, there is no provision for collecting keyword arguments in Emacs Lisp.

Python setup

Pymacs requires little or no setup in the Python modules which are meant to be used from Emacs, for the simple situations where these modules receive nothing but Emacs nil, numbers or strings, or return nothing but Python None, numbers or strings.

Otherwise, use from Pymacs import lisp. If you need more Pymacs features, like the Let class, write from Pymacs import lisp, Let.

Response mode

When Python receives a request from Emacs in the context of Pymacs, and until it returns the reply, Emacs keeps listening to serve Python requests. Emacs is not listening otherwise. Other Python threads, if any, may not call Emacs without very careful synchronisation.

#@+node:ekr.20071103091052.3:Emacs lisp symbols
Emacs Lisp symbols

lisp is a special object which has useful built-in magic. Its attributes do nothing but represent Emacs Lisp symbols, created on the fly as needed (symbols also have their built-in magic).

lisp.nil or lisp["nil"], are the same as None.

Otherwise, lisp.symbol and lisp[string] yield objects of the internal Symbol type. These are genuine Python objects, that could be referred to by simple Python variables. One may write quote = lisp.quote, for example, and use quote afterwards to mean that Emacs Lisp symbol. If a Python function received an Emacs Lisp symbol as an argument, it can check with == if that argument is lisp.never or lisp.ask, say. A Python function may well choose to return lisp.t.

In Python, writing lisp.symbol = value or lisp[string] = value does assign value to the corresponding symbol in Emacs Lisp space. Beware that in such cases, the lisp. prefix may not be [omitted] spared. After result = lisp.result, one cannot hope that a later result = 3 will have any effect in the Emacs Lisp space : this would merely change the Python variable result, which was a reference to a Symbol instance, so it is now a reference to the number 3.

The Symbol class has value() and copy() methods. One can use either lisp.symbol.value() or lisp.symbol.copy() to access the Emacs Lisp value of a symbol, after conversion to some Python object, of course. However, if value() would have given an Emacs Lisp handle, lisp.symbol.copy() has the effect of lisp.symbol.value().copy(), that is, it returns the value of the symbol as opened as possible.

A symbol may also be used as if it was a Python function, in which case it really names an Emacs Lisp function that should be applied over the following function arguments. The result of the Emacs Lisp function becomes the value of the call, with all due conversions of course.

As Emacs Lisp uses dynamic bindings, it is common that Emacs Lisp programs use
let for temporarily setting new values for some Emacs Lisp variables having
global scope. These variables recover their previous value automatically when
the let gets completed, even if an error occurs which interrupts the normal flow
of execution.

Pymacs has a Let class to represent such temporary settings. Suppose for example
that you want to recover the value of lisp.mark() when the transient mark mode
is active on the Emacs Lisp side. One could surely use lisp.mark(lisp.t) to
force reading the mark in such cases, but for the sake of illustration, let's
ignore that, and temporarily deactivate transient mark mode instead. This could
be done this way :

         try :
     	let = Let()
     	let.push(transient_mark_mode=None)
     	... user code ...
         finally :
     	let.pop()

let.push() accepts any number of keywords arguments. Each keyword name is
interpreted as an Emacs Lisp symbol written the Pymacs way, with underlines. The
value of that Emacs Lisp symbol is saved on the Python side, and the value of
the keyword becomes the new temporary value for this Emacs Lisp symbol. A later
let.pop() restores the previous value for all symbols which were saved together
at the time of the corresponding let.push(). There may be more than one
let.push() call for a single Let instance, they stack within that instance. Each
let.pop() will undo one and only one let.push() from the stack, in the reverse
order or the pushes.

When the Let instance disappears, either because the programmer does del let or
let = None, or just because the Python let variable goes out of scope, all
remaining let.pop() get automatically executed, so the try/finally statement may
be omitted in practice. For this omission to work flawlessly, the programmer
should be careful at not keeping extra references to the Let instance.

The constructor call let = Let() also has an implied initial .push() over all
given arguments, so the explicit let.push() may be omitted as well. In practice,
this sums up and the above code could be reduced to a mere :

     let = Let(transient_mark_mode=None)
     ... user code ...

Be careful at assigning the result of the constructor to some Python variable.
Otherwise, the instance would disappear immediately after having been created,
restoring the Emacs Lisp variable much too soon.

Any variable to be bound with Let should have been bound in advance on the Emacs
Lisp side. This restriction usually does no kind of harm. Yet, it will likely be
lifted in some later version of Pymacs.

The Let class has other methods meant for some macros which are common in Emacs
Lisp programming, in the spirit of let bindings. These method names look like
push_* or pop_*, where Emacs Lisp macros are save-*. One has to use the matching
pop_* for undoing the effect of a given push_* rather than a mere .pop() : the
Python code is clearer, this also ensures that things are undone in the proper
order. The same Let instance may use many push_* methods, their effects nest.

push_excursion() and pop_excursion() save and restore the current buffer, point
and mark. push_match_data() and pop_match_data() save and restore the state of
the last regular expression match. push_restriction() and pop_restriction() save
and restore the current narrowing limits. push_selected_window() and
pop_selected_window() save and restore the fact that a window holds the cursor.
push_window_excursion() and pop_window_excursion() save and restore the current
window configuration in the Emacs display.

As a convenience, let.push() and all other push_* methods return the Let
instance. This helps chaining various push_* right after the instance
generation. For example, one may write :

         let = Let().push_excursion()
         if True :
     	... user code ...
         del let

The if True: (use if 1: with older Python releases, some people might prefer
writing if let: anyway), has the only goal of indenting user code, so the scope
of the let variable is made very explicit. This is purely stylistic, and not at
all necessary. The last del let might be omitted in a few circumstances, for
example if the excursion lasts until the end of the Python function.

Raw Emacs Lisp expressions

Pymacs offers a device for evaluating a raw Emacs Lisp expression, or a sequence of such, expressed as a string. One merely uses lisp as a function, like this :

     lisp("""
     ...
     possibly-long-sequence-of-lisp-expressions
     ...
     """)


The Emacs Lisp value of the last or only expression in the sequence becomes the value of the lisp call, after conversion back to Python.
#@-node:ekr.20071103091052.5:Raw Emacs lisp expression
#@+node:ekr.20071103091052.6:User interaction
User interaction

Emacs functions have the concept of user interaction for completing the specification of their arguments while being called. This happens only when a function is interactively called by the user, it does not happen when a function is programmatically called by another. As Python does not have a corresponding facility, a bit of trickery was needed to retrofit that facility on the Python side.

After loading a Python module but prior to creating an Emacs view for this
module, Pymacs decides whether loaded functions will be interactively callable
from Emacs, or not. Whenever a function has an interaction attribute, this
attribute holds the Emacs interaction specification for this function. The
specification is either another Python function or a string. In the former case,
that other function is called without arguments and should, maybe after having
consulted the user, return a list of the actual arguments to be used for the
original function. In the latter case, the specification string is used verbatim
as the argument to the (interactive ...) function on the Emacs side. To get a
short reminder about how this string is interpreted on the Emacs side, try C-h f
interactive within Emacs. Here is an example where an empty string is used to
specify that an interactive has no arguments::

         from Pymacs import lisp

         def hello_world() :
     	"`Hello world' from Python."
     	lisp.insert("Hello from Python!")
         hello_world.interaction = ''

Versions of Python released before the integration of PEP 232 do not allow users
to add attributes to functions, so there is a fallback mechanism. Let's presume
that a given function does not have an interaction attribute as explained above.
If the Python module contains an interactions global variable which is a
dictionary, if that dictionary has an entry for the given function with a value
other than None, that function is going to be interactive on the Emacs side.
Here is how the preceeding example should be written for an older version of
Python, or when portability is at premium::

         from Pymacs import lisp
         interactions = {}

         def hello_world() :
     	"`Hello world' from Python."
     	lisp.insert("Hello from Python!")
         interactions[hello_world] = ''

One might wonder why we do not merely use lisp.interactive(...) from within
Python. There is some magic in the Emacs Lisp interpreter itself, looking for
that call before the function is actually entered, this explains why
(interactive ...) has to appear first in an Emacs Lisp defun. Pymacs could try
to scan the already compiled form of the Python code, seeking for
lisp.interactive, but as the evaluation of lisp.interactive arguments could get
arbitrarily complex, it would a real challenge un-compiling that evaluation into
Emacs Lisp.
#@-node:ekr.20071103091052.6:User interaction
#@+node:ekr.20071103091052.7:Key bindings
Keybindings

An interactive function may be bound to a key sequence.

To translate bindings like C-x w, say, one might have to know a bit more how
Emacs Lisp processes string escapes like \C-x or \M-\C-x in Emacs Lisp, and
emulate it within Python strings, since Python does not have such escapes. \C-L,
where L is an upper case letter, produces a character which ordinal is the
result of subtracting 0x40 from ordinal of L. \M- has the ordinal one gets by
adding 0x80 to the ordinal of following described character. So people can use
self-inserting non-ASCII characters, \M- is given another representation, which
is to replace the addition of 0x80 by prefixing with `ESC', that is 0x1b.

So \C-x in Emacs is '\x18' in Python. This is easily found, using an interactive
Python session, by givin it : chr(ord('X') - ord('A') + 1). An easier way would
be using the kbd function on the Emacs Lisp side, like with lisp.kbd('C-x w') or
lisp.kbd('M-<f2>').

To bind the F1 key to the helper function in some module :

     lisp.global_set_key((lisp.f1,), lisp.module_helper)

(item,) is a Python tuple yielding an Emacs Lisp vector. lisp.f1 translates to
the Emacs Lisp symbol f1. So, Python (lisp.f1,) is Emacs Lisp [f1]. Keys like
[M-f2] might require some more ingenuity, one may write either (lisp['M-f2'],)
or (lisp.M_f2,) on the Python side.

#@+node:ekr.20071103092153.1:The *pymacs* buffer
The *Pymacs* buffer

Emacs and Python are two separate processes (well, each may use more than one process). Pymacs implements a simple communication protocol between both, and does whatever needed so the programmers do not have to worry about details. The main debugging tool is the communication buffer between Emacs and Python, which is named *Pymacs*. As it is sometimes helpful to understand the communication protocol, it is briefly explained here, using an artificially complex example to do so. Consider :

     (pymacs-eval "lisp('(pymacs-eval \"`2L**111`\")')")
     "2596148429267413814265248164610048L"

Here, Emacs asks Python to ask Emacs to ask Python for a simple bignum computation. Note that Emacs does not natively know how to handle big integers, nor has an internal representation for them. This is why I use backticks, so Python returns a string representation of the result, instead of the result itself. Here is a trace for this example. The < character flags a message going from Python to Emacs and is followed by an expression written in Emacs Lisp. The > character flags a message going from Emacs to Python and is followed by a expression written in Python. The number gives the length of the message.

     <22   (pymacs-version "0.3")
     >49   eval("lisp('(pymacs-eval \"`2L**111`\")')")
     <25   (pymacs-eval "`2L**111`")
     >18   eval("`2L**111`")
     <47   (pymacs-reply "2596148429267413814265248164610048L")
     >45   reply("2596148429267413814265248164610048L")
     <47   (pymacs-reply "2596148429267413814265248164610048L")

Python evaluation is done in the context of the Pymacs.pymacs module, so for example a mere reply really means Pymacs.pymacs.reply. On the Emacs Lisp side, there is no concept of module namespaces, so we use the pymacs- prefix as an attempt to stay clean. Users should ideally refrain from naming their Emacs Lisp objects with a pymacs- prefix.

reply and pymacs-reply are special functions meant to indicate that an expected result is finally transmitted. error and pymacs-error are special functions that introduce a string which explains an exception which recently occurred. pymacs-expand is a special function implementing the copy() methods of Emacs Lisp handles or symbols. In all other cases, the expression is a request for the other side, that request stacks until a corresponding reply is received.

Part of the protocol manages memory, and this management generates some extra-noise in the *Pymacs* buffer. Whenever Emacs passes a structure to Python, an extra pointer is generated on the Emacs side to inhibit garbage collection by Emacs. Python garbage collector detects when the received structure is no longer needed on the Python side, at which time the next communication will tell Emacs to remove the extra pointer. It works symmetrically as well, that is, whenever Python passes a structure to Emacs, an extra Python reference is generated to inhibit garbage collection on the Python side. Emacs garbage collector detects when the received structure is no longer needed on the Emacs side, after which Python will be told to remove the extra reference. For efficiency, those allocation-related messages are delayed, merged and batched together within the next communication having another purpose.

Variable pymacs-trace-transit may be modified for controlling how and when the *Pymacs* buffer, or parts thereof, get erased.

Emacs usual debugging

If cross-calls between Emacs Lisp and Python nest deeply, an error will raise successive exceptions alternatively on both sides as requests unstack, and the diagnostic gets transmitted back and forth, slightly growing as we go. So, errors will eventually be reported by Emacs. I made no kind of effort to transmit the Emacs Lisp backtrace on the Python side, as I do not see a purpose for it : all debugging is done within Emacs windows anyway.

On recent Emacses, the Python backtrace gets displayed in the mini-buffer, and the Emacs Lisp backtrace is simultaneously shown in the *Backtrace* window. One useful thing is to allow to mini-buffer to grow big, so it has more chance to fully contain the Python backtrace, the last lines of which are often especially useful. Here, I use :

         (setq resize-mini-windows t
     	  max-mini-window-height .85)


in my .emacs file, so the mini-buffer may use 85% of the screen, and quickly shrinks when fewer lines are needed. The mini-buffer contents disappear at the next keystroke, but you can recover the Python backtrace by looking at the end of the *Messages* buffer. In which case the ffap package in Emacs may be yet another friend! From the *Messages* buffer, once ffap activated, merely put the cursor on the file name of a Python module from the backtrace, and C-x C-f RET will quickly open that source for you.

Auto-reloading on save

I found useful to automatically pymacs-load some Python files whenever they get saved from Emacs. This can be decided on a per-file or per-directory basis. To get a particular Python file to be reloaded automatically on save, add the following lines at the end :

     # Local Variables :
     # pymacs-auto-reload : t

Let's say I have a a module, call it manglers.py, containing this simple python
function::

    def break_on_whitespace(some_string) :
         words = some_string.split()
         return '\n'.join(words)

The goal is telling Emacs about this function so that I can call it on a region
of text and replace the region with the result of the call. We shall also bind
this function to the key [f7].

Here is the Python side::
@color

#@+node:ekr.20071103093725:Example 3: defining a rebox tool
For comments held within boxes, it is painful to fill paragraphs, while
stretching or shrinking the surrounding box by hand, as needed. This piece of
Python code eases my life on this. It may be used interactively from within
Emacs through the Pymacs interface, or in batch as a script which filters a
single region to be reformatted.

In batch mode, the reboxing is driven by command options and arguments and expects a
complete, self-contained boxed comment from a file.

Emacs function rebox-region also presumes that the region encloses a single
boxed comment.

Emacs rebox-comment is different, as it has to chase itself the extent of the
surrounding boxed comment.

#@+node:ekr.20071103094355:The python side
Design notes for rebox.py:

Pymacs specific features are used exclusively from within the pymacs_load_hook
function and the Emacs_Rebox class. In batch mode, Pymacs is not even imported.

In batch mode, as well as with rebox-region, the text to handle is turned over
to Python, and fully processed in Python, with practically no Pymacs interaction
while the work gets done. On the other hand, rebox-comment is rather Pymacs
intensive: the comment boundaries are chased right from the Emacs buffer, as
directed by the function Emacs_Rebox.find_comment. Once the boundaries are
found, the remainder of the work is essentially done on the Python side.

Once the boxed comment has been reformatted in Python, the old comment is
removed in a single delete operation, the new comment is inserted in a second
operation. This occurs in Emacs_Rebox.process_emacs_region. But by doing so, if
point was within the boxed comment before the reformatting, its precise position
is lost. To well preserve point, Python might have driven all reformatting
details directly in the Emacs buffer. We really preferred doing it all on the
Python side : as we gain legibility by expressing the algorithms in pure Python,
the same Python code may be used in batch or interactively, and we avoid the
slowdown that would result from heavy use of Emacs services.

To avoid completely loosing point, I kludged a Marker class, which goal is to
estimate the new value of point from the old. Reformatting may change the amount
of white space, and either delete or insert an arbitrary number characters meant
to draw the box. The idea is to initially count the number of characters between
the beginning of the region and point, while ignoring any problematic character.
Once the comment has been reboxed, point is advanced from the beginning of the
region until we get the same count of characters, skipping all problematic
characters. This Marker class works fully on the Python side, it does not
involve Pymacs at all, but it does solve a problem that resulted from my choice
of keeping the data on the Python side instead of handling it directly in the
Emacs buffer.

We want a comment reformatting to appear as a single operation, in the context
of Emacs Undo. The method Emacs_Rebox.clean_undo_after handles the general case
for this. Not that we do so much in practice : a reformatting implies one
delete-region and one insert, and maybe some other little adjustements at
Emacs_Rebox.find_comment time. Even if this method scans and mofifies an Emacs
Lisp list directly in the Emacs memory, the code doing this stays neat and
legible. However, I found out that the undo list may grow quickly when the Emacs
buffer use markers, with the consequence of making this routine so Pymacs
intensive that most of the CPU is spent there. I rewrote that routine in Emacs
Lisp so it executes in a single Pymacs interaction.

Function Emacs_Rebox.remainder_of_line could have been written in Python, but it
was probably not worth going away from this one-liner in Emacs Lisp. Also, given
this routine is often called by find_comment, a few Pymacs protocol interactions
are spared this way. This function is useful when there is a need to apply a
regexp already compiled on the Python side, it is probably better fetching the
line from Emacs and do the pattern match on the Python side, than transmitting
the source of the regexp to Emacs for it to compile and apply it.

For refilling, I could have either used the refill algorithm built within in
Emacs, programmed a new one in Python, or relied on Ross Paterson's fmt,
distributed by GNU and available on most Linuxes. In fact, refill_lines prefers
the latter. My own Emacs setup is such that the built-in refill algorithm is
already overridden by GNU fmt, and it really does a much better job. Experience
taught me that calling an external program is fast enough to be very bearable,
even interactively. If Python called Emacs to do the refilling, Emacs would
itself call GNU fmt in my case, I preferred that Python calls GNU fmt directly.
I could have reprogrammed GNU fmt in Python. Despite interesting, this is an
uneasy project : fmt implements the Knuth refilling algorithm, which depends on
dynamic programming techniques; Ross did carefully fine tune them, and took care
of many details. If GNU fmt fails, for not being available, say, refill_lines
falls back on a dumb refilling algorithm, which is better than none.
#@-node:ekr.20071103094355:The python side
#@+node:ekr.20071103094355.1:The emacs side
For most Emacs language editing modes, refilling does not make sense
outside comments, one may redefine the `M-q' command and link it to this
Pymacs module.  For example, I use this in my `.emacs' file::

    (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'fp-c-mode-routine)
    (defun fp-c-mode-routine ()
        (local-set-key "\M-q" 'rebox-comment))
    (autoload 'rebox-comment "rebox" nil t)
    (autoload 'rebox-region "rebox" nil t)

with a "rebox.el" file having this single line:

    (pymacs-load "Pymacs.rebox")

The Emacs function `rebox-comment' automatically discovers the extent of the
boxed comment near the cursor, possibly refills the text, then adjusts the box
style. When this command is executed, the cursor should be within a comment, or
else it should be between two comments, in which case the command applies to the
next comment.

The Emacs function `rebox-region' does the same, except that it takes the
current region as a boxed comment. Both commands obey numeric prefixes to add or
remove a box, force a particular box style, or to prevent refilling of text.
Without such prefixes, the commands may deduce the current box style from the
comment itself so the style is preserved.

The default style initial value is nil or 0.  It may be preset to another
value through calling `rebox-set-default-style' from Emacs LISP, or changed
to anything else though using a negative value for a prefix, in which case
the default style is set to the absolute value of the prefix.

A `C-u' prefix avoids refilling the text, but forces using the default box
style.  `C-u -' lets the user interact to select one attribute at a time.

Adding new styles
-----------------

Let's suppose you want to add your own boxed comment style, say:

    //--------------------------------------------+
    // This is the style mandated in our company.
    //--------------------------------------------+

You might modify `rebox.py' but then, you will have to edit it whenever you
get a new release of `pybox.py'.  Emacs users might modify their `.emacs'
file or their `rebox.el' bootstrap, if they use one.  In either cases,
after the `(pymacs-load "Pymacs.rebox")' line, merely add:

    (rebox-Template NNN MMM ["//-----+"
                             "// box  "
                             "//-----+"])

In batch mode [If you use the `rebox' script rather than Emacs], the simplest is to make
your own.  This is easy, as it is very small.  For example, the above
style could be implemented by using this script instead of `rebox':

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import sys
    from Pymacs import rebox
    rebox.Template(226, 325, ('//-----+',
                              '// box  ',
                              '//-----+'))
    apply(rebox.main, tuple(sys.argv[1:]))

In all cases, NNN is the style three-digit number, with no zero digit.
Pick any free style number, you are safe with 911 and up.  MMM is the
recognition priority, only used to disambiguate the style of a given boxed
comments, when it matches many styles at once.  Try something like 400.
Raise or lower that number as needed if you observe false matches.

Usually, the template uses three lines of equal length.  Do not worry if
this implies a few trailing spaces, they will be cleaned up automatically
at box generation time.  The first line or the third line may be omitted
to create vertically opened boxes.  But the middle line may not be omitted,
it ought to include the word `box', which will get replaced by your actual
comment.  If the first line is shorter than the middle one, it gets merged
at the start of the comment.  If the last line is shorter than the middle
one, it gets merged at the end of the comment and is refilled with it.

"""\
Handling of boxed comments in various box styles.

Introduction
------------

For comments held within boxes, it is painful to fill paragraphs, while
stretching or shrinking the surrounding box "by hand", as needed.  This piece
of Python code eases my life on this.  It may be used interactively from
within Emacs through the Pymacs interface, or in batch as a script which
filters a single region to be reformatted.  I find only fair, while giving
all sources for a package using such boxed comments, to also give the
means I use for nicely modifying comments.  So here they are!

Box styles
----------

Each supported box style has a number associated with it.  This number is
arbitrary, yet by _convention_, it holds three non-zero digits such the the
hundreds digit roughly represents the programming language, the tens digit
roughly represents a box quality (or weight) and the units digit roughly
a box type (or figure).  An unboxed comment is merely one of box styles.
Language, quality and types are collectively referred to as style attributes.

When rebuilding a boxed comment, attributes are selected independently
of each other.  They may be specified by the digits of the value given
as Emacs commands argument prefix, or as the `-s' argument to the `rebox'
script when called from the shell.  If there is no such prefix, or if the
corresponding digit is zero, the attribute is taken from the value of the
default style instead.  If the corresponding digit of the default style
is also zero, than the attribute is recognised and taken from the actual
boxed comment, as it existed before prior to the command.  The value 1,
which is the simplest attribute, is ultimately taken if the parsing fails.

A programming language is associated with comment delimiters.  Values are
100 for none or unknown, 200 for `/*' and `*/' as in plain C, 300 for `//'
as in C++, 400 for `#' as in most scripting languages, 500 for `;' as in
LISP or assembler and 600 for `%' as in TeX or PostScript.

Box quality differs according to language. For unknown languages (100) or
for the C language (200), values are 10 for simple, 20 for rounded, and
30 or 40 for starred.  Simple quality boxes (10) use comment delimiters
to left and right of each comment line, and also for the top or bottom
line when applicable. Rounded quality boxes (20) try to suggest rounded
corners in boxes.  Starred quality boxes (40) mostly use a left margin of
asterisks or X'es, and use them also in box surroundings.  For all others
languages, box quality indicates the thickness in characters of the left
and right sides of the box: values are 10, 20, 30 or 40 for 1, 2, 3 or 4
characters wide.  With C++, quality 10 is not useful, it is not allowed.

Box type values are 1 for fully opened boxes for which boxing is done
only for the left and right but not for top or bottom, 2 for half
single lined boxes for which boxing is done on all sides except top,
3 for fully single lined boxes for which boxing is done on all sides,
4 for half double lined boxes which is like type 2 but more bold,
or 5 for fully double lined boxes which is like type 3 but more bold.

The special style 221 is for C comments between a single opening `/*'
and a single closing `*/'.  The special style 111 deletes a box.

Batch usage
-----------

Usage is `rebox [OPTION]... [FILE]'.  By default, FILE is reformatted to
standard output by refilling the comment up to column 79, while preserving
existing boxed comment style.  If FILE is not given, standard input is read.
Options may be:

  -n         Do not refill the comment inside its box, and ignore -w.
  -s STYLE   Replace box style according to STYLE, as explained above.
  -t         Replace initial sequence of spaces by TABs on each line.
  -v         Echo both the old and the new box styles on standard error.
  -w WIDTH   Try to avoid going over WIDTH columns per line.

So, a single boxed comment is reformatted by invocation.  `vi' users, for
example, would need to delimit the boxed comment first, before executing
the `!}rebox' command (is this correct? my `vi' recollection is far away).

Batch usage is also slow, as internal structures have to be reinitialised
at every call.  Producing a box in a single style is fast, but recognising
the previous style requires setting up for all possible styles.

Emacs usage
-----------

For most Emacs language editing modes, refilling does not make sense
outside comments, one may redefine the `M-q' command and link it to this
Pymacs module.  For example, I use this in my `.emacs' file:

     (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'fp-c-mode-routine)
     (defun fp-c-mode-routine ()
       (local-set-key "\M-q" 'rebox-comment))
     (autoload 'rebox-comment "rebox" nil t)
     (autoload 'rebox-region "rebox" nil t)

with a "rebox.el" file having this single line:

     (pymacs-load "Pymacs.rebox")

Install Pymacs from `http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~pinard/pymacs.tar.gz'.

The Emacs function `rebox-comment' automatically discovers the extent of
the boxed comment near the cursor, possibly refills the text, then adjusts
the box style.  When this command is executed, the cursor should be within
a comment, or else it should be between two comments, in which case the
command applies to the next comment.  The function `rebox-region' does
the same, except that it takes the current region as a boxed comment.
Both commands obey numeric prefixes to add or remove a box, force a
particular box style, or to prevent refilling of text.  Without such
prefixes, the commands may deduce the current box style from the comment
itself so the style is preserved.

The default style initial value is nil or 0.  It may be preset to another
value through calling `rebox-set-default-style' from Emacs LISP, or changed
to anything else though using a negative value for a prefix, in which case
the default style is set to the absolute value of the prefix.

A `C-u' prefix avoids refilling the text, but forces using the default box
style.  `C-u -' lets the user interact to select one attribute at a time.

Adding new styles
-----------------

Let's suppose you want to add your own boxed comment style, say:

    //--------------------------------------------+
    // This is the style mandated in our company.
    //--------------------------------------------+

You might modify `rebox.py' but then, you will have to edit it whenever you
get a new release of `pybox.py'.  Emacs users might modify their `.emacs'
file or their `rebox.el' bootstrap, if they use one.  In either cases,
after the `(pymacs-load "Pymacs.rebox")' line, merely add:

    (rebox-Template NNN MMM ["//-----+"
                             "// box  "
                             "//-----+"])

If you use the `rebox' script rather than Emacs, the simplest is to make
your own.  This is easy, as it is very small.  For example, the above
style could be implemented by using this script instead of `rebox':

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import sys
    from Pymacs import rebox
    rebox.Template(226, 325, ('//-----+',
                              '// box  ',
                              '//-----+'))
    apply(rebox.main, tuple(sys.argv[1:]))

In all cases, NNN is the style three-digit number, with no zero digit.
Pick any free style number, you are safe with 911 and up.  MMM is the
recognition priority, only used to disambiguate the style of a given boxed
comments, when it matches many styles at once.  Try something like 400.
Raise or lower that number as needed if you observe false matches.

On average, the template uses three lines of equal length.  Do not worry if
this implies a few trailing spaces, they will be cleaned up automatically
at box generation time.  The first line or the third line may be omitted
to create vertically opened boxes.  But the middle line may not be omitted,
it ought to include the word `box', which will get replaced by your actual
comment.  If the first line is shorter than the middle one, it gets merged
at the start of the comment.  If the last line is shorter than the middle
one, it gets merged at the end of the comment and is refilled with it.

History
-------

I first observed rounded corners, as in style 223 boxes, in code from
Warren Tucker, a previous maintainer of the `shar' package, circa 1980.

Except for very special files, I carefully avoided boxed comments for
real work, as I found them much too hard to maintain.  My friend Paul
Provost was working at Taarna, a computer graphics place, which had boxes
as part of their coding standards.  He asked that we try something to get
him out of his misery, and this how `rebox.el' was originally written.
I did not plan to use it for myself, but Paul was so enthusiastic that I
timidly started to use boxes in my things, very little at first, but more
and more as time passed, still in doubt that it was a good move.  Later,
many friends spontaneously started to use this tool for real, some being very
serious workers.  This convinced me that boxes are acceptable, after all.

I do not use boxes much with Python code.  It is so legible that boxing
is not that useful.  Vertical white space is less necessary, too.  I even
avoid white lines within functions.  Comments appear prominent enough when
using highlighting editors like Emacs or nice printer tools like `enscript'.

After Emacs could be extended with Python, in 2001, I translated `rebox.el'
into `rebox.py', and added the facility to use it as a batch script.

To generate a SSH key using PuTTY:

Execute c:\"Program Files"\tortoiseCVS\PUTTYGEN.EXE

Select "SSH2 DSA", within the "Parameters" section.

Click on the "Generate" button. Follow the instruction to move the mouse over
the blank area of the program in order to create random data used by PUTTYGEN to
generate secure keys. Key generation will occur once PUTTYGEN has collected
sufficient random data.

Enter edream@cvs.sourceforge.net for the key comment (depends on what host the
key is for)

(Omit) Enter the desired passphrase in the "Key passphrase" and "Confirm passphrase"
fields. If the key will be used for automation of operations (i.e. as part of a
script), you may choose to omit this step from the key generation process.

Click on the "Save private key" button. Use the resulting dialog to save your
private key data for future use. You may use a filename such as
"SourceForge-Shell.ppk" or "SourceForge-CF.ppk". The .ppk extension is used for
PuTTY Private Key files.

Go to the SSH key posting page on the SourceForge.net site: http://sourceforge.net/account/

Copy your public key data from the "Public key for pasting into OpenSSH
authorized_keys2 file" section of the PuTTY Key Generator, and paste the key
data to the provided form on the SourceForge.net site. Click on the "Update"
button to complete the posting process.

Exit the PuTTY Key Generator (PUTTYGEN).

Key data sync to hosts from the SourceForge.net site occurs on regular
intervals. Your key data will be synchronized to the designated servers (either
shell and CVS, or the Compile Farm) after a short delay.

@nocolor

I have a fair bit of expertise on CVS branches. It's late at night, so I don't have time for a long soapbox spiel at the moment. I will try to post something tomorrow. 

The brief picture is: 

* Check out code from CVS at the point you want to create the branch. 

* Make sure none of the files in your sandbox is modified. 

* Create the branch (cvs tag -b branchname). The branch name must start with a letter (upper or lower case) and thereafter can have alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores (no periods or spaces). 

* The branch is created on the repository, but your sandbox is still checked out on the main branch. To check out on the new branch, do "cvs up -r branchname". 

When you want to merge changes back into the main branch, you can use "cvs up -r MAIN" to retrieve the main branch, then "cvs up -j branchname" to merge changes, then "cvs commit" to commit the merged version to the main branch AFTER YOU HAVE VERIFIED IT. 

I would recommend caution with merging because as you have noted, leo files are not well set up for CVS. They don't merge well because of inconsistent sentinel values. 

You may want to look at manually merging changes back into the main branch until leo implements invariant unique (UUID) sentinel indices. 

This will not hurt your ability to use branches, only your ability to automatically merge changes from one branch onto another.

@nocolor

- Add new entries in the following Python dictionariues in leoApp.py:
  self.language_delims_dict, self.language_extension_dict and self.extension_dict

- Add an entry to the languages list in <<configure language-specific settings>>

- Add a list of the keywords of the language to << define colorizer keywords >>

  N.B.: the name of this list must be x_keywords, where x is the entry in language in step a.

- Add any language-specifig code to leoColor.colorizeAnyLanguage.
  For most languages nothing need be done.

- If the language is case insensitive, add it to the list of
case_insensitiveLanguages found in  << define global colorizer data >>

- Create the files theLanguage.xml and theLanguage.py file was added to the leo\modes directory.
  See Chapter 15 of Leo's users guide for full details.

TESTS

- Test the syntax coloring for the new language by using the @language directive.

Very interesting indeed - great work! 

I didn't have Java/Jython installed so for others in the same boat here's what I had to do to get it work on my platform (Win2k). Some of this is in the README but I had to do some extra but I'm not sure why. 

1. Install 1.5 JDK  
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp 

2. Install Jython 
http://www.jython.org/jython22a1.zip 

3. Edit Jython.bat file - the part that calls Java.exe to ... 
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_02\jre\bin\java" -cp "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_02\jre\lib";"c:\Apps\Python23\Jython";"C:\Apps\jLeo\j-leo-MAR15\Icons";"C:\Apps\jLeo\j-leo-MAR15\skins";"C:\Apps\jLeo\j-leo-MAR15\src";"C:\Apps\jLeo\j-leo-MAR15\skinimages" -Dpython.home="c:\Apps\Python23\Jython" -jar jython.jar %ARGS%

#@+node:ekr.20070623150151:How to make Leo commands undoable
The chapter commands provide a good example.  In this file, see the node:

Code-->Core classes...-->@thin leoChapters.py-->class chapterController-->Undo

The general plan is this:

1. The command handler calls a **beforeCommand** method before changing the outline.

The beforeCommand method creates a g.Bunch that contains all the information needed to
restore the outline to its previous state. Typically, the beforeCommand method
will call c.undoer.createCommonBunch(p), where p is, as usual, c.p.

2. After changing the outline the command handler calls an **afterCommand** method.

This method should take as one argument the g.Bunch returned by the
beforeCommand method. In the discussion below, denote this bunch by b. The
afterCommand method adds any information required to redo the operation after
the operation has been undone.

The afterCommand method also sets b.undoHelper and b.redoHelper to two method
that actually perform the undo and redo operations. (Actually, the beforeCommand
method could also set these two entries).

When the afterCommand method has 'filled in' all the entries of b, the
afterCommand method must call u.pushBead(b). This pushes all the undo
operation on a stack managed by the Leo's undoer, i.e., c.commands.undoer.

3. The undoer calls the undoHelper and redoHelper methods to perform the actual undo and redo operations.

The undoer handles most of the housekeeping chores related to undo and redo.  All the undoHelper and redoHelper methods have to do is actually alter Leo's outline.

**Note**: the undoer creates an ivar (instance variable) of the *undoer* class for every entry in the bunch b passed as an argument to u.pushBead(b).  For example, suppose u = c.commands.under and that b has ivars 'a','b' and 'c'.  Then, on entry to the undoHelper and the redoHelper the u.a, u.b and u.c ivars will be defined.  This makes it unnecessary for the undoHelper or the redoHelper to 'unpack' b explicitly.

Writing correct undo and redo helpers is usually a bit tricky.  The code is often subtly different from the original code that implements a command.  That just can't be helped.

@nocolor-node

http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/ac3f8789010c882e

Ville's completer is working and very cool, here are instructions for
making it go.  They're like the instructions Ville gave, only usable ;-)

1. (done) Make sure you have exuberant ctags (not just regular ctags)
installed.  It's an Ubuntu package, so easy if you're using Ubuntu.

2. (done) Install Ville's python module "codewise".  This is a small module on
which the Leo plugin relies.

   bzr branch lp:codewise
   cd codewise
   sudo python setup.py install

3. (done) You need a recent trunk version of leo to get the plugin which uses
the above module.

4. (done) Enable the plugin by putting "codewisecompleter.py" on an
uncommented line in your @enabled-plugins @settings node.

5. On the command line:

if you have an existing ~/.ctags for some reason, and it's nothing you
need to keep:

  rm ~/.ctags

then

  codewise setup
  codewise init
  codewise parse .../path/to/leo/  # assuming you want completion on
                                   # leo code
  codewise parse .../some/other/project/

Then, after restarting leo if necessary, type

c.op<Alt-0> in the body editor to find all the c. methods starting
with 'op' etc.


===== Ville's response

Especially the presentation part (QCompleter) needs some care, so you
can operate it from your keyboard alone. It should probably be moved
to core (qtgui, perhaps leoQTextEditWIdget), so codewise completer can
just invoke w.complete(list_of_completions) that will bring up the
QCompleter popup.

> Then, after restarting leo if necessary, type

> c.op<Alt-0> in the body editor to find all the c. methods starting
> with 'op' etc.

Also, try the explicit declarations:

# w : SomeClass

w.<alt+0>

And self.<alt+0>
#@+node:ekr.20091217112515.6069:Others posts
@nocolor-node

1. codewisecompleter.py now completes by explicit type hints (as seen in
screenhots). p, c also work, as does 'self'.

self works by scanning for parent headlines looking for "class Foo"

Work remains for presentation part (it's mouse only now) but Edward
will probably do it :-).

2. > Would codewise work outside of leo, as stand-alone plugin for a text
> editor?

Yes, currently Leo uses it as an external program ("codewise m
MyClass" dumps the methods in MyClass to stdout).

Someone just has to write the vim integration plugin (or whatever they
call it). OTOH, vim already has "pysmell" and the likes that do the
same thing.

==============

The version of codewise completer that works with Tk is now on trunk.

- You need to create ctags file to ~/.leo/tags. Example::

    cd ~/.leo
    ctags -R /usr/lib/python2.5 ~/leo-editor ~/my-project

- Enter text you want to complete and press alt+0 to show completions
  (or bind/execute ctags-complete command yourself).

Attempting to complete 'foo->' is useless, but 'foo->ba' will work (provided you
don't have 2000 functions/methods starting with 'ba'. 'foo->' portion is ignored
in completion search.

Sorry for being a bit vague, I was talking about the Leo source files themselves. I don't know what you use to edit them, ;^))) but in version 3.6 they still have \r\n as end-of-line. 

If Leo itself does not solve the problem, may I suggest the 
Tools/scripts/crlf.py script in the Python source distibution? It's nice and simple, and skips binary files, too. That's what I use every time I install a new version of Leo. :^) 

#@+node:ekr.20031218072017.387:The solution
Under unix, python writes "\n" as "\n"; under windows, it writes it as "\r\n". The unix python interpreter ignores trailing "\r" in python source files. There are no such guarantees for other languages. Unix users should be able to get rid of the cosmetically detrimental "\r" either by running dos2unix on the offending files, or, if they're part of a .leo project, reading them into leo and writing them out again.

 RE: Removing '\r' characters?   
2002-09-17 09:34  
Oh, I see. Thanks very much for this clarification. 

Just to make sure I understand you: the problem with '\r' characters is that: 

1. I am creating LeoPy.leo and LeoDocs.leo on Windows and 
2. People are then using these files on Linux. 

and the way to remove the '\r' characters: 

1. I could run dos2unix on all distributed files just before committing to CVS or making a final distribution or 
2. People could, say, do the following: 

Step 1: Read and Save the .leo files, thereby eliminating the '\r' in those files and 
Step 2: Use the Write @file nodes command on all derived files to clear the '\r' in those files. 

Do you agree so far? 

> Under unix, python writes "\n" as "\n"; under windows, it writes it as "\r\n". 

I am going to see if there is any way to get Python to write a "raw" '\n' to a file. I think there must be. This would solve the problem once and for all. 

Thanks again for this most helpful comment.

Nope. Exactly wrong. In 2.2 and those before, when files are opened in
*text* mode (no "b") then reading them will provide Unix-style line endings
(newline only). When you open files in binary mode then you see the bytes
stored in the file.

On Unix systems there's no difference in the contents of a file whether in
binary or text mode. On Windows a file is shorter by the number of carriage
returns. On the Mac I have no idea what they do. Probably just carriage
returns, to be different :-)

2.3 will be a bit more flexible about such mattrers.

I dont know if anyone has solved this for regular Leo, but in the JyLeo JythonShell,
when the user executes a script with Pdb it:
1. dumps the script in a tmp file system's tmp directory.
2. Executes pdb based off of that tmp file.

that way you get all the goodness that pdb can offer.

Sorry to take so long to reply.  I've been buried in work and haven't kept up
with some email.

Here's the link to the site where I posted the folder you have:
<http://homepage.mac.com/jdgleeson/>  It's the small file named "Leo.zip" (23
KB), not the large file "Leo-4.3-alpha-2.dmg" (20 MB).

I agree that I did not write very clear instructions, beginnng with the first
step, where I should have also said:  "It is important to use version 1.1.8
of py2app, which is only available through svn.  The version on the py2app website
is 1.1.7, which creates buggy Tkinter apps. If you try to use version 1.1.7,
the Leo app it creates will give you a message saying that Tkinter is not properly
installed.  Your installation is fine; otherwise you could not have even built
Leo.app with py2app, because py2app copies the essential parts of Tcl/Tk into
the application bundle to make the app completely standalone."

I haven't tried intalling the Fink subversion -- I'm using DarwinPorts
<http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/>.  But there's a simpler alternative than
DarwinPorts. Metissian releases OS X packages of Subversion clients
<http://metissian.com/projects/macosx/subversion/>

AFAIK, the command "python setup.py bdist_mpkg --open" only applies to the py2app
1.1.8 distribution.  By the way, bdist_mpkg is distributed with py2app. It creates
a package around the setup.py script (more specialized than Platypus).  I don't
have any experience with bdist_mpkg yet.

'Copy the leo folder into this directory' is horrible. I'm glad you figured
it out -- I'm not sure I could have.

"python setup.py py2app -a" should be run in the folder with the readme file,
which also contains the setup.py file that the command refers to.  Most importantly,
the folder in which this command is run must contain the leo folder -- which
it does only if you are brilliant enough to decode my instructions.   ;)

Subject:  Leo, Mac OS X 10.3, and VPython 

I've been evaluating leo or vpython programming on  Mac OS X 10.3, and 
have some observations and a suggestion.

Observations:
- Leo runs under X11 as well as under OS X.
- My X11 python configuration was created using the recipe at XXX (which enables vpython).
- The OS X configuration is vanilla MacPython from MacPython.org, along with AquaTclTk batteries included XXX.

In both environments I can run leo under python leo.py and under idle.
Under OS X we get font smoothing, but we can't run visual python programs (python crashes;  this is a known incompatibility with  MacPython.)

- Under X11 we can run visual python programs like this one
    #box.py
    from visual import *
    box()

And we can even run them under leo (under X11). HOWEVER, when the visual python program is terminated, leo vanishes (leo and the vp program apparently run in the same space)

Under x11, we can keep leo alive by putting the vp program in its own space:

    os.popen3('/sw/bin/python /Users/jis/box.py')

However,  this doesn't let us see the output of stderr and stdout.  
Those text streams are available...

    def do(cmd='ls'):
        from os import popen3
        pIn,pOut,pErr=0,1,2
        popenResults=popen3(cmd)
        print popenResults[pOut].read()
        print popenResults[pErr].read()

    import os	
    do('/sw/bin/python /Users/jis/box.py')

...but only when the vpython program terminates.

Here's the good news:  if we execute our vp program with 
/sw/bin/idle.py rather than with python, we get to see the program 
output in real time (under idle, under X11).

    import os	
    os.chdir('/sw/lib/python2.3/idlelib')
    os.popen3('/sw/bin/python idle.py -r /Users/jis/box.py')

#this runs as an executed script in leo, and produces a live idle 
with real time ongoing output.

Now, while idle is running, leo sits in suspended animation.  But when 
the vpython program terminates, we are left in idle, and when idle is 
terminated, leo becomes active again.

It would be even better if leo were not suspended (using os.spawn, 
perhaps) but the real point is that I would really really like leo's 
"Execute script" command to execute code this way and spare me having 
to  hard-write the path to box.py.  It ought to be possible to 
eliminate os.chdir as well.

Yes, fink does have pre-built Pythons, both 2.1 and 2.2.  (If you don't 
see them it probably means you don't have the right servers listed in 
your /sw/etc/apt/sources.list file.)  However, the versions of Python 
you'd get through fink are set up to run under X Windows, which I don't 
think is what you want.

I think what you want is MacPython which can run Tk programs like Leo 
under Aqua.  That's what I use these days.

I can tell from your question that you don't understand the following 
differences between the versions of Python available:

1) The version that comes with OS X is a text only one which doesn't 
have Tk.  Leo can't run under that.  Also, I hate Apple for including 
this instead of one that does have Tk and I hope they'll fix it some 
day.

2) You can get a version of Python from fink with has Tk but which runs 
under X Windows.  I don't think you want that.

3). You can also get MacPython which has Tk but it's a version of Tk 
that uses the Aqua windowing system, not X Windows.

So Tk can either be present or not and if it is present it can use 
either X Windows or Aqua.  You want it present and using Aqua, I think.

Nope.  The python installed by FC knows nothing about the Mac.  It 
thinks it's running on a Unix machine.  And it uses a version of Tk 
which thinks it's running on a Unix machine.  The window standard on 
Unix is called X (or X11 or XFree86, all the same thing).  So the main 
reason to run Leo this way would be to get an idea of how it works for 
Unix/Linux users.  But when programs run under X, they don't look like 
Mac programs.  They don't get all those glossy, translucent widgets 
that Aqua provides.  They really look like they would on a Unix/Linux 
machine.

Aqua is the native windowing system on Mac.  MacPython is set up to 
work with it.  Most Mac users will want Leo to work this way.  That's 
what I do.

Yes, I think that's all I installed to get Tk to work under Aqua.  You 
don't have to deinstall the FC stuff.  All the FC stuff lives in its 
own world under /sw and runs under X.  It won't conflict with the Mac 
world.

Double-clickable things (i.e. Macintosh applications) are usually 
actually folders with a name that ends in .app.  The file you found is 
probably executable only from the command line, not by double clicking 
it.  So I think if you run it from the command line it will work but 
will not know about Tk because Apple's version was built without Tk 
support.

You can also execute the .app programs from the command line by using 
the open command, so "open foo.app" will do the same thing as double 
clicking on foo in the finder (the .app extension is suppressed).  The 
idea behind this is that an application can look like just one opaque 
icon in the finder but actually have all its resources nicely organized 
in subfolders.

Some highlights:
* simpler startup:
jyleo leo.py
should be sufficient to start it up.
* new editor colorization
* the JythonShell is much more powerful and cooler
* new plugins
* Chapters support
* mod_script is in place.
* dyna-menu was converted.  I guess 'e' will have to judge the conversion.
* multi-language script support.
* drag and drop
* some powerful new editor commands.  Try keyword completing on the language
in effect.  Say if it is python:
se(Tab)
becomes
self

Some warnings:
1. Be careful about reading your regular leo files into jyleo and saving them.
Its quite conceivable that jyleo will write it out to an XML format that regular
leo can't handle.  Why?  Well jyleo is using an XML library to spit its XML
out while leo uses a home grown method.  The library can handle leo's XML, but
Ive seen regular leo not be able to handle jyleo's XML.  Its based around <tag/>
I believe.

2. If you move jyleo after executing it you will need to clear out your compiled
py files as the __file__ attribute is hard compiled into the resulting objects.
Not what we want.  We want it to be set at runtime.  Ive been waiting a long
time for jython to release again and hopefully fix this, but Im not holding
my breath anymore.

----------
Its hard to give this thing a number, I want to call it jyleo2, but jyleo is
sufficient.  Dependent upon bug reports the next release could be much sooner
than before, maybe even weeks.  I hope one thing, that the dreaded "I can't
get it to start" problems are gone.  I took the snapshot and expanded it in
Windows XP.  Went to the src directory and typed: jython leo.py
and it started.  That's what I wanted to see.  I didn't have to mess with the
CLASSPATH or anything.

things needed:
java 5
a jython2.2a1 or beyond.  jython2.2a1 is the most recent snapshot.

Beyond bug fixing, I will be planning to add more SwingMacs command as time
goes along.  But I think most major features are in place.  Of course the 3D
experiments in the future could change that... :D

A NOTE ON STARTUP TIMES: In my experience it takes awhile for jyleo to start.
It will take much longer the first time you execute it because the py files
are being compiled.  Ive haven't been able to figure out what eats the time,
it may just have a slow startup in the aggregate.  So don't think its not doing
anything, it probably is.

It is worth noting that NT, Win2K and XP all have an alternative which is
to add .PY to the PATHEXT environment variable. Then you can run any .PY
file directly just by typing the name of the script without the extension. 

e.g.
C:\>set PATHEXT=.COM;.EXE;.BAT;.CMD

C:\>set PATH=%PATH%;c:\python22\tools\Scripts

C:\>google
'google' is not recognized as an internal or external command,

and almost takes the place of the "shabang" line at the top of *nix

Many thanks for this detailed summary.  I think this is the guarantee I need
a) to experiment with threads and b) to fiddle with settings should that 
appear to be necessary.

Just be careful.  Test your assumptions before you rely on them, especially regarding threads.  Generally threading is seen as a "hard" problem.  If you want to help make them easier, use Queues to handle inter-thread communication.

Googling this leads directly to an entry in the Python Cookbook.  The site
is down at present.  I'll study this entry when it's back up.

The basic idea is to have each task be a generator, with each generator giving up control after some amount of work.  Here's a variant of the recipe in the cookbook... 

 - Josiah

import collections

tasks = collections.deque()

def busy():
    while 1:
        yield None

def delay(v):
    import time
    while 1:
        time.sleep(v)
        yield None 

def xpasses(x):
    while x > 0:
        x -= 1
        yield None

def runtasks():
    while 1:
        task = tasks.popleft()
        try:
            task.next()
        except StopIteration: 
            pass
        else:
            tasks.append(task)

>This is due to apparent glitches in the Tk event dispatching. The problem is
that pressing a control or alt or shift key _all by themselves_ will generate
keypress events that are passed on to Leo's key handlers

This should be easy to make simpler--just bind an empty script to <Alt-KeyPress>,
<Shift-KeyPress>, etc.  Tk chooses the most specific event it can find, so the
more general <KeyPress> handler will not fire.

On a broader note, when programming the text widget in Tcl/Tk, watching key
events is not the easiest way to detect changes in the text.  The only way the
text in a text widget can change is if either the delete or the insert subcommands
(methods) are called.  Any keypresses that end up changing text will have called
one of these subcommands.

So the simplest way to detect changes is to just intercept the calls to insert
and delete.  In Tcl/Tk intercepting these calls is pretty straightforward. 
I don't know if the same is true in Tkinter.

Also note the text widget in Tk8.4 (http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkCmd/text.htm#M72)
has a built-in way of seeing if the text has changed

Here are the emacs features that I use very often that any editor would
need to have in order for me to switch.  I've seen some editors with
some of these, but none with all unless it is an emacs clone.  I'll
leave out the obvious things like platform independence, good syntax
highlighting, calltips or auto-completion.  Also, these features are
just dealing with the code editor portion of the app, if it is more than
that (like a full IDE) then some of these things may or may not apply to
the non code editor parts:

* (done) Python should be just one of the languages that this editor supports,
not the primary target.  I spend as much time in C/C++ as I do Python,
and my editor of choice needs to help me with C/C++ coding just as much
as it does with Python.  So some sort of support for calltips and
auto-completion would be marvelous, and also being able to act as a
front-end for gdb since I currently use emacs for that most of the time.

* (done) Absolutely every feature or action must be able to be done with just
the keyboard.  Moving the hand back and forth to the mouse wastes time,
breaks concentration and contributes to RSI.  Multi-key sequences are
fine as long as they are grouped in a logical fashion.  For example in
emacs all of the version control features are accessible via the
Ctrl-x,v sequence plus one more letter.

* (done) Incremental search, both forward and reverse, and wrapping around
after you've reached the end or the beginning of the document.  I like
to have the same key to start the search and also do a search-next after
you've typed all the characters you are searching for, and also to have
backspace go back one search position and/or remove one character from
the search text.

* (done) Multiple top level windows, and able to show any buffer in any TLW,
including those that are already displayed in another TLW.  Of course
there should be key-bindings available for opening a new TLW, cycling
forward and backward through the buffer list, and a way to select a
buffer from a popup list of buffer/file names.

* (to be improved) The Kill-Ring.  For those of you that have never used an emacs-like
editor it works like this:  There is a collection of the N previous
blocks of text that have been cut or copied (in emacs 'cut' == 'kill'
more or less)  When I do a yank (paste) it uses the last thing put in
the kill-ring.  If I then immediately use another key-binding then it
replaces that pasted text with the next item in the kill ring, and so on
until I eventually wrap around get back to the first one in the ring, or
I do some other command or move the cursor somewhere else.

* (done) Registers.  A text snippet can be copied into a register, which is
like the kill ring except you refer to each one by name, where the names
are 'a' through 'z'.  You can also append to a register that already has
text in it, and you can paste the contents of a register into the
document at the current cursor location.

* (done) Able to have selections be either a stream of characters or a
rectangle.  A stream selection is like what you have in all text
editors, it starts from position a on line N and continues forward or
back to position b on line M and includes all the characters in between.

  A rectangle selection is all the characters between position a and b
on lines N to M.  In other words, it has width and height and it might
be something like positions 5 through 10 on lines 20 to 25.  Cutting or
deleting a rectangle removes the text in the rectangle and shifts any
text to the right of the rectangle over.  It does not remove any lines
although they may end up being empty.  Pasting a rectangle inserts the
new text with the upper-left of the rectangle at the current cursor
position, shifts existing text to the right if needed, and fills with
spaces on the left if a line affected by the paste is not long enough.
New lines are not added unless the file needs to be extended to
accommodate the rectangle paste.  Rectangles can also be put into registers.

* (to be improved) Good keystroke macro recording and the ability to save and load
keystroke macros, and the ability to assign a key-binding to a saved
recorded macro. Any time I need to make the same edits to a bunch of
lines or groups of lines I'll record doing it on the first one including
the keystrokes needed to reposition for the next line, and then stop
recording and then it's just one keystroke to replay the keystrokes for
every other line that needs it done.  I record, use and throw away up to
a dozen or so macros per day.

* (done, and better than asserted) If you must have a toolbar make it optional
and keep it simple. Toolbars require the mouse and the goal is to keep the hand
off the mouse as much as possible.

* (done) Similarly, avoid using popup dialogs whenever possible.  This includes
things like the file dialog.  I don't mind seeing the file dialog if I
select a menu item, because most likely my hand is already on the mouse,
but the rest of the time I just want to hit a key, type a path name
(with tab-completion to help find stuff, up/down keys to cycle through
past selections) and press enter.  So I would prefer this editor to have
something like emacs' minibuffer, or the QuickFind panel in Firefox.  In
other words, when there is something you would normally use a dialog for
just create a small panel that rolls up from the bottom of the frame,
put the keyboard focus there, perhaps do stuff in the main buffer as
they are typing if appropriate, and then when the user is done the panel
rolls out of sight again and keyboard focus is restored to their active
buffer.  This can be done for file open/saves, search & replace,
specifying build or grep commands (see next item) choosing to execute
some editor function by name that may not have some key-binding yet (see
item after next) etc.

* (done, with user @commands)

Flexible build/grep commands.  Emacs handles both of these in almost
the same way so I'll list them together here.  I hit a key and am
presented with either the default, or the most recently used compile or
grep command.  I can edit the command or use the up/down arrows to
select previous commands that I've used.  I then hit enter and emacs
runs the command putting the output in an editor buffer.  There is a key
I can hit to kill the compile if needed.  It then parses the output and
there is a key I can use to find the file listed in the compile or grep
output, load it, and position the cursor on the reported line.  (This
can even be done while the compile/grep is still running.)

* (done) For access to editor commands/functionality that may not be bound to a
keystroke it's real nice to have the ability to hit a key, type the
command name, press enter and then it's done.  This can also allow for
commands that might need to prompt for parameters, be interactive, etc.
  All editor commands should be named and can be bound to keys by name
or executed by name in this way.

* (done) Regex search.  Emacs has support for regular expression search modes
for all of the search types, incremental search, search/replace,
although I don't use it that much.

* (done, or not needed, depending on your point of view)
Multi-file search and replace.  Be able to select files interactively,
or by wildcard, or both.  Enter search string, or regex, and replace
text.  The editor loads each file and does the search, allowing you to
choose for each one whether to do the replacement, or replace all.

* If it is a full IDE it would be nice to have a way to start just the
code editor portion for quick edits.

Things that would be nice to have, but that I could live without:

(All of these things can be done easily with @command)

* Interactive diffs, merges and applying of patches.

* Able to be a front-end for gdb.

* Able to be a front-end for CVS, SVN, etc.

* (done) Be able to run shell commands, or the shell itself in an editor buffer.

* (easy) have a built-in psychotherapist or be able to play towers of hanoi.  ;-)

Robin Dunn's post, reproduced at:
http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/4f76a0f57759aba
continues to be one of the benchmarks for Leo.

Leo 4.7 went out the door today.  It contains many important
improvements, but few directly related to Robin's important post.
That doesn't mean Robin's post is irrelevant, but it does mean that
other considerations were more relevant :-)  In particular, Leo passes
all unit tests with Python 2.6 and Python 3.1.

Leo 4.8 will concentrate on better support for vim-like bindings.  As
a happy side effect, this will make Leo compliant with almost all
unfinished aspects of Robin's mission.

There are two major items from Robin's list that are incomplete in
Leo:

* The Kill-Ring.  Leo does have a kill ring.  The vim work will fix
discrepancies between how Leo, emacs and vim handle the kill ring.

* Good keystroke macro recording and the ability to save and load
keystroke macros.  This happen as part of support for vim's "dot"
command.  To some extent, Leo's execute-script command compensates for
wimpy macro support, but I'd like to do better.

The following could be done easily using Leo's @command or @button
features.  There doesn't seem to be much demand for them in Leo, but
I'll list them here for completeness.

- Flexible build/grep commands.
- Interactive diffs, merges and applying of patches.
- Able to be a front-end for gdb. (Leo has a plugin to do this).
- Able to be a front-end for CVS, SVN, etc.
- Have a built-in psychotherapist or be able to play towers of
hanoi.  ;-)

As always, I invite you all to try Leo, and to ask for features that
would be important to you.

======

P.S. Leo does have auto-completion.  It will be improved in Leo 4.9.
